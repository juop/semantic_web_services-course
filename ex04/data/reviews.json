Our 4th floor room was an attic with a vaulted ceiling that angles down to 3ft. The bed is only accessible from one side. If you placed your head in the skylight on the other side you might able sit up. The bathtub was impractical with broken shower head. We moved to the 1st floor the next day and within minutes found a centipede on the wall and15 flies. We asked for a broom to get rid of the centipede. Later in the day the receptionist said she gave us something to control the bugs. We never complained about the drain flies so she must have noticed a problem. That night we spent 2 hrs catching 6 centipedes in our room. 2 came from throw pillows. We asked reception for a new room or hotel but there supposedly weren't any hotels with open rooms and if we wanted leave we would have to pay for transportation and both hotels. The next morning we went to reception to tell them about the bug problem. We barely said anything before the woman apologized and said they didn't put the bugs in the room on purpose so we should just go about our day and forget it. She added that she often goes on vacation with her children and sometimes things happen, so she tries to make the best of everything and not start a war. Adding, a few euros isn't going to make anything go away so we should just go enjoy the day because more we talk the less time we have.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/274","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/470"},{"id":21,"date":"2015-04-11T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"We had absolutely no problems whatsoever with this hotel and were very pleasantly surprised by the quality considering the low price. The dcor of the room was pleasant and flawless, unlike many of the Venice hotels I've stayed in. The breakfast buffet was delicious too. And to finish all this off, the staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. In terms of location, the hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the Lido waterbus stop, then a boat takes around 15 mins to get into Venice. We didn't find this a problem at all - we knew this was going to be the case so had pre-booked transport tickets to save money. The surrounding Lido is pleasant and worth an explore in a spare couple of hours. In conclusion, I would book this again due to the fantastic quality of the hotel, despite the trade-off of not being in Venice itself.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/670","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/768"},{"id":22,"date":"2015-04-06T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"Wir buchten das Hotel fr 4 Nchte in der Woche vor Ostern. Der Aufenthalt war durchweg angenehm. Das Frhstcksbuffet war reichhaltig und frisch (allerdings rate ich von dem Rhrei ab). Wenn etwas aufgebraucht war, wurde es umgehend aufgefllt. Vom Frhstcksraum aus konnte man den Blick ber die Lagune genieen. Obwohl unser Zimmer im Erdgeschoss zur Nebenstrae hin lag, war es dort sehr ruhig. Die Einrichtung ist geschmackvoll und zweckmig. An Sauberkeit mangelte es nicht. Obwohl wir nicht den Anspruch stellten, wurden die Handtcher tglich gewechselt. Das einzige Manko war die Temperatur des Duschwassers. Es wechselte stndig von ziemlich kalt zu sehr hei. Erwhnenswert ist auch das Waschbecken. Der Wasserhahn ist ziemlich klein und so ber dem hervorstehenden berlauf angebracht, dass es schon schwierig ist, die Hnde darunter zu waschen. Der Empfang an der Rezeption war sehr freundlich. Leider war unser Koffer nicht mit uns angekommen. Die nette Empfangsdame kmmerte sich darum und hielt Kontakt mit dem Flughafen. Am nchsten Tag wurden wir vom Hotel aus benachrichtigt, dass unser Koffer nun da sei. Gleich in der Nhe des Hotels ist eine Bushaltestelle. Wir fuhren allerdings nie mit dem Bus, da der Weg zum Anleger fr die Wasserbusse nicht weit war.

I requested flowers for the room as it was one of my wife's special birthday's, and yes they ordered exactly as requested, can't ask for more. Rooms are a little on the small side but in line with most European hotels of this standard so wasn't a surprise or a problem, room and bathroom was cleaned every day with fresh towels supplied each day. Buffet breakfast had various options to suit most peoples taste but It was a surprise to see sausage, bacon and scrambled eggs available, must have been put on to satisfy us Brits! We stayed during late September so the Lido is probably quieter at that time however we felt very safe walking around late at night back to the hotel but taxis are available if you feel a little vulnerable. Restaurants and coffee bars are located in the main commercial area close to the Waterbus stations and tend to be slightly cheaper than in Venice. We had a water taxi (think luxury speed boat!) from the airport to the hotel and back again, quite an experience, a little costly but well worth it, a lot quicker and less hassle than the Waterbus. Venice was very busy during the day time, St Marks Square at night is a must, fantastic atmosphere. All in all we had a great time in Venice, it can be a little expensive so don't ponder over the bills to much, just pay up with a smile!","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/493","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/965"},{"id":26,"date":"2015-08-04T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"Mysigt med fina rum, bra frukost och nra bde till stranden och btterminalen.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/540","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/814"},{"id":27,"date":"2015-04-10T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"Hotel ist sehr gut, wir waren zum zweiten mal in diesem Hotel.

The hotel is on the Lido, which is about a 10-15 minute waterbus ride away from Venice. However, if you're looking for a place on the Lido, this is a well-priced option. The staff was great with handling/recommending dinner reservations, even during an insane Carnevale weekend. The doors are a little thin and since the building is old, the soundproofing needs improvement. The quarters are cramped, but the room comes with breakfast. If we wanted to stay on the Lido again, this would be a good option, but next time I think we'll opt for a place closer to the action.

We pickup a beagle and coffee and went to our room. They should have planned ahead for all the teens to eat all the food. There was 45 minutes left for breakfast time but nothing to eat.

Upon checking in was told that the place was booked with folks who are running from Isaac -- the folks are depressed, sad and crying -- we got a room with no problem as a matter of fact the parking lot and inside hotel were rather empty despite the fact that the place was booked -- the room reaked -- air conditioning unit blew out luke warm air despite having control turned to high cool -- linens and bath towels were rough and ...view morewell worn. The corridors reaked of curry/incense and it was obvious other air freshners were used to mask the obvious odors. Not opposed to other cultures but if you are going to have that sort of thing waifing through the hotel you should advertise such. My expectations are a clean room with no visible signs of anything else... would NOT recommend this place... BTW the free breakfast was nothing more than day old bakery goods with what was suppose to be biscuits and gravy... the folks running from Isaac would have been better off to weather the storm!

Our room had a nice view that seemed like we were in the woods. Indoor basketball and tennis court as well outdoor tennis courts just to name a few. Even has a lap pool (not sure if it was olympic size though). All gears and equipment are provided free of charge so no need to bring racquets, balls and even shoes. Just make sure to wear or bring socks but worry not as they sell socks if you happen to forget. We all enjoyed our stay. From my wife getting pampered inside their spa for most of the time to me and our teenage kids working a lot of sweat playing all sorts of sports. The only thing that was somewhat awkward for us was that their recreational pool was filled wth mostly small kids and toddlers with their Soccer Moms or the Rich Wives of Beverly hills type of women. Not really encouraging for a full grown man who likes to drink his cold beer by the pool or teenage kids/young adults doing their horsing around or whatever. Their lap pool is always occupied and Waiting a while for a lane to be vacant somewhat takes the fun out of it. Over all, It's a magnificent place to stay with so many things to enjoy while you're at it.

There were a few hiccups in our stay, but we had such a nice time that the things that did go wrong are forgiven. The staff did try their best to makeup for the mishaps, which shows that they do care about their guests. I will say the bathrooms are very small (when you open the door there is only about 5 inches from the door to the toilet). The vanity and mirror is spacious, but definitely not for 2 people at once. The Trellis Spa and service from its staff is impeccable, and the gym and outdoor amenities makeup for the age of the hotel. It is hidden away from the busy roads and noise of the surrounding area, so you really feel like you are able to relax as if you were somewhere far away. The views out the windows all around the hotel are views of beautiful tress, as if you were in a secluded rainforest. As other reviewers mentioned, the valet service was really top notch and on their game. We will definitely be returning for a staycation at The Houstonian again.

The property is connected to the Houstonian Club which is a separate sports club that has truly world class facilities. It has 3 pools (a massive lap pool, resort pool and other small quiet pool), the largest gym I have seen anywhere, basketball and tennis courts, a jogging track and at least 5 studios for classes. My wife has been a regular (5 times a week) gym user for over 16 years and she has been a member of many gyms in NYC and London and this is by far the best she has experienced. She went to 3 classes and the studios, instructors and equipment could not have been better. Further there is no need to register for any class you just turn up and participate. In the luxurious locker rooms there is free coffee, tea, ice tea, water etc... We also ate at the bar and Olivette restaurant and the food and service were excellent.

I'm guessing the filters need to be cleaned and/or replaced more frequently.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/995","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/695"},{"id":480,"date":"2016-06-18T00:00:00Z","rating":2,"comment":"I am a 75yr old Disabled Vet and had requested 2 bed room on first floor as I have walking disability from service.

Rooms are decent but you can forget about the amenities they advertise. The pool is nice, but good luck finding a towel or staff person. Its not easy to get the complimentary breakfast.......you need to know the secret handshake then be prepared to wait an hour for a server and even more for the meal to cook. If you try to have breakfast there take a look around the restaurant and see how many table have food.......or more likely you will see empty tables with angry/hungry customers and 1 server trying to keep everyone happy.Its a decent hotel that does not hire enough staff to maintain the amenities. I feel bad for the employees of this hotel.......they are very pleasant but obviously over worked. This hotel is good if you need a place to crash but that is about it.

Mini fridge and microwave in room were a plus. Pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment. Restaurant food was good (we got a 14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost 20) but service was very slow. The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room. The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there. Overall this was a decent hotel and much better than what others in our group experienced at competitors in the area.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/396","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/879"},{"id":492,"date":"2015-08-17T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"The hotel was very clean, comfortable, and accommodating to the fact that we had a dog.

They said the housekeepers had all gone home. The restaurant was terrible service. One person waiting on the room over breakfast the first day. Twenty minutes to receive a menu and then nothing after the meal was delivered. We got our own flatware and coffee. The second day there was more staff but the waitress decided to change my plain yogurt to blueberry. I am allergic. Had to send it back. I asked for a manager to contact me but no one called. Called corporate and they wanted to give me points. Called Mr. Kong, the president of Best Western and they will give me a 50.00 credit, the first offer was a gift certificate for 50.00 No thanks, I wont ever stay in another Best Western again.

Nicest staff ever! Room was clean and comfortable, is a single story building, so rooms go on forever down long hallways. Lucky we were near the gym, which was better than most. Great breakfast at a very reasonable price. Room includes a voucher for up to 14.00 of your breakfast order, so you get a hot meal straight from the short order cook, not some steam table/cereal bar like most places. Portions were huge! Free buffet with pizza, cheese/crackers, veggies and dip from 4-7pm on Friday evenings in the bar. Facility is a bit quirky and a bit tired, but staff is warm and friendly.Wish we had eaten dinner there and not at the disappointing Chinese restaurant next door!","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/203","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/426"},{"id":549,"date":"2016-02-14T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"We enjoyed two great days away.

Restaurant food was good (we got a $14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost $20) but service was very slow. The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room. The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there.

Room could have been a little cleaner especially the carpet and corners of room. Lots of dust so allergies became a problem. BIG NOTE! This is a dog friendly hotel! I love dogs and have 2 of my own but do not bring them to hotels. The 2nd night a dog actually 2 dogs started barking at 4:00 am. We were woken up until @6:00! The hotel usually has the 1st floor reserved for barking dogs but these people ended up on the 2nd floor. The Hotel kindly gave us credit for the one night.

The workout facitlies are shared with the local peoples, who buy membership - so competition to use treadmills with folks other than those staying at the hotel. I had a sirlion steak for dinner and it was 3/4 fat, advertised with cajun spices - it had none - tasted as though it was thawed and boilded in water - disgusting.

The pictures of the property on the web did not match what we actually experienced.No security at the hotel, as all of the doors from the parking lot and center courtyard where broken and not using the key pad to enter. Anyone could enter the building. Crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building. The A/C unit was very old with missing knobs and instructions that were worn off. Getting the room to a comfortable temperature was a challenge. Dirty used towels were hanging in the shower questioning whether the room had been properly cleaned from the prior occupant. Duct tape was used to patch the holes in the curtains. To top that off the mattress was as hard as a rock making sleeping nearly impossible.If it was not for us driving all day and that it was late in the evening we would have not stayed at this hotel. Worst experience at a hotel in my life time. To top it off, we paid way too much for the room based on the experience and status of the property.

We had time to go echeck it out before actually booking!! We asked to see a room and were very pleasantly surprises by how lovely and new the hotel and room was!! They. Have done a great job of the Reno!! The hallways, rooms and main areas are clean plus and very tastefully decorated!! The room had great beds and high end quality linens. The room was large and spacious!! We stayed at the hotel for dinner as there was a bar/restaurant on the premesis!! Super friendly staff and the food was of very good quality for pub food!! Nice not to have to go looking for a place to eat after being on the road all day! Another of the hotel amenities was the great gym and pool area!! Dosen,t get any better anywhere!!! High end equipment , pool and jacuzzi!, another great perk is, in the morning the from lobby staff give you a $7.00 voucher per person for breakfast in the hotel!!! This is not your average Best Western!! We had a lovely bacon/ egg brkf for $0,,, All the staff were super friendly and seemed like they loved their jobs!!! My only complaint is the fact that people are allowd to smoke in some of the rooms!! Smoking is not segregated by floors!! We instantly could smell cig smoke when we went to the second floor!! We also could smell MJ coming from one room!! To bad this hotel is allowing smoking within especially since they have done such a fine job of renovating!! In this day and age, smoking in hotels or anywhere inside is just not acceptable!!

The room was dirty when we checked in.  The next day they never sent housekeeping to clean.  Did not give us clean towels in spite of the request for those and housekeeping services.  They said the housekeepers had all gone home.  The restaurant was terrible service.  One person waiting on the room over breakfast the first day.  Twenty minutes to receive a menu and then nothing after the meal was delivered.  We got our own flatware and coffee.  The second day there was more staff but the waitress decided to change my plain yogurt to blueberry.  I am allergic.  Had to send it back.  I asked for a manager to contact me but no one called.  Called corporate and they wanted to give me points.  Called Mr. Kong, the president of Best Western and they will give me a $50.00 credit, the first offer was a gift certificate for $50.00  No thanks, I wont ever stay in another Best Western again.

I'm in grad school so I needed cheap. Considering the price, the hotel amenities and upkeep was as expected. The staff was friendly enough, the hotel smelled like mildew, serious updates were needed, and the continental breakfast was lacking. The only things that I considered to be under what I paid was the bed and room itself. The bed was terribly uncomfortable. The pillows were hard and lumpy...like when you wash and then high heat dry artificial pillow stuffing and it melts together. The AC unit didn't really work. It just blew air. I was hoping it would cool down to kill the mildew smell, but it never did. The worst was that every time the AC unit kicked off, a noise would start (I'm assuming some kind of duct work) that sounded like someone was knocking at my door.

We paid (with tax) 155.00 for the room with 3 beds due to the fact we have older kids and they refuse to sleep in the same bed (no biggie) when we got to our room for the night and turned down the bed the cover had several hairs in-bedded in the cover, the sheets had several cigarette burn holes in it. So needless to say NO ONE slept in the 3rd bed. There was a dead bug under the counter that the coffee maker was on (coffee and no cups) the outlet by the coffee maker when we went to plug in the straighter it would just fall out, the outlet behind the nightstand was literally hanging out of the wall. The little doily that I'm assuming should have been on the table under the phone was behind the table and on the floor, I'm sure was there for some time...I totally understand a quick cheap place to stay but, when you are up all night worrying about if the place is going to burn down!! NO THANKS! I'm glad our room was at the end of the hall by the EXIT door. You will not find my family there. I did speak to a manager (I'm assuming since he said he could hear out my issues) and he gave me a whopping 20 off so instead of 155 I am paying 124.00 not satisfied and will not return. Who pays even 124.00 to stay in a place like this!! HJ 1 myself 0..I lost on this bad decision making. I wish I could get the picture to upload.

Several choices for breakfast (make-your-own waffles, biscuits and gravy, eggs, sausage, doughnuts, cereal, toast, yogurt, apples, fruit juice, milk, etc.) and you can get small discounts on tickets to several attractions if you purchase vouchers at front desk. The only very minor service/room condition complaints we had were that one of the electrical outlets was pulling out of the wall, that we had to call to request replacement shampoo/conditioner the second night, and also when we requested pool towels shortly before pool closing, we were asked to go to the front desk to get them, as they could not bring them down to the pool towel cabinet for us at that time (no big deal unless you're already wet from the pool, of course!)

I liked the room layout and comfortable bed with good linens and pillows. The buffet breakfast was extensive including fruit, eggs and sausage (as well as the ubiquitous waffle maker) and low-sugar syrup. What was strange was how closely the breakfast bar attendant watched my every move. I think she was trying to be responsive, but she asked me what I was looking for every time I glanced at the selections. The cons for me were the age of the furniture and fixtures and the cleanliness. I have never cited cleanliness in a review-I can let a lot of things pass. But I cannot accept obvious, fresh stains on both the bath vanity and kitchenette counter, especially when they wipe away easily with water, suggesting that not even a rag was dragged across them. The hotel staff was very nice, but always a turn-off for me when they walk in from their cigarette break at the front of the hotel as you walk in behind them. Surprisingly this hotel and the Wingate were nearly equally ranked (and priced) on this site. They are not similar in quality. I checked out the Wingate while in town. It has a much nicer lobby and breakfast room, where a hot breakfast is provided, not a continental as described. The room I was shown had newer furniture, granite kitchenette counter and tile tub/shower surround. Closer to town, it has a few stores within walking distance.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/255","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/329"},{"id":1053,"date":"2015-11-06T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"I told the lady at the desk that I don't have any complaints with the hotel.

Upon arrival there was 3 people in front of us in line. All 3 people were there to complain and to ask for their money back. There was 2 people wanting their money refunded due to bed bugs that they had found in their room and another asking for a refund because the hotel was unable to give them the accommodations that were promised. The man at front desk was very argumentative and rude. When it was our turn we immediately explained that we were a little nervous to stay based on what we just witnessed. His logic was we might as well stay here because he was not going to give our money back and in addition to that he was insisting that we pay him 20 in cash because our child is 15 and anyone over 14 must pay additional charge. I again explained that we was just worried about bed bugs and he said that it was fine because he had called exterminator and thus had done everything he could. He was unreasonable and rude. I left the lobby in tears. We decided to inspect the room and found items that had been left there from the previous customers all over the room.

I'm used to staying in MUCH nicer hotels, but for a somewhat last minute trip and wanting to be close to the beach and center of town its what We settled for. The pool was decent and I think it was heated at night. The room was not the best, it was somewhere to sleep and put our stuff, is what it was. Nothing fancy or extra AT ALL. the sheets had a hole and they were not changed everyday. And there wasn't even an actual comforter on the bed. We had to febreeze it( it had a stale smell) and I wiped down the room myself when we got there.( for my own assurance) But we still stayed for 4 nights 5 days. We went to target,radio shack, a little grocery shopping and the mall (with Dave and busters) ect. and the furthest we ever drove was still less then 10 mins. And the beach and broad walk was a half a mile down the street. I personally would never choose to stay here again but it wasn't the worst either. Like I said it was somewhere to stay and so affordable (under our normal hotel budget) and location wise, it was great, we were in the middle of everything.

There was a small free wi-fi allowance, but if you wanted more you had to pay a small charge - it did however work well (compared to other hotels I've stayed at). There was a charge for parking your car at the hotel. Not very much, but a bit of a cheek when there's no real alternative. It's a bit like a restaurant charging you extra to use cutlery! It was also a bit tricky to find. There's a sign on the main road saying to turn right after 200 metres, but even if you're good at estimating distances and take the correct turning, you could still fail to find it!

They are both friendly and engaging professionals that strive for excellence. They make sure youll have a memorable dining experience, for sure. They and their ...view morestaff do a fantastic job. Kim provided ample, courteous, attentive servers, and bartenders. We didnt wait for anything all night. I just cant say enough about the incredible service and food. GOOGLE the name to see their web site. The pictures look exactly like the restaurant. This is a cool inn. They also have an outside bar that our group enjoyed, stocked with all the liquors/wines anyone could want first class. The portions of food were plentiful, especially the desserts. The dining room was tastefully illuminated while the glasses, dishes and silverware sparkled. Everything is extra clean and inviting. Inside are several fire places to add a romantic ambiance. So if youre looking to celebrate an anniversary, or special occasion, choose this lovely Inn and you wont be disappointed. Entres range from 21 (chicken) to 31 (filet Mignon). A very quixotic atmosphere, I must say.

My room (classic) was fine, even though the layout of it was unfortunate, but the hotel is old and I guess they can't help the big pilar in middle... I booked through Hotels.com and asked for a quiet room. They remembered this and gave me a room on the street side, which was definitely quieter. In addition, the room had a separate door leading to the bedroom, which made the experience quieter. The breakfast was great and included sparkling wine. I enjoyed the fresh fruit and croissants! I wasn't that impressed by dinner, however. I had a steak, which was cooked as I asked, and the wine was good with it, but the list overall just wasn't to my taste. The pool area only have staff bringing out the lounge chair mattresses at 10am though, so if you're earlier than that you have to bring your own towel from your room and settle with that... this was a bit disappointing. Also while they serve you drinks and snacks to your lounge chair, they will not come to you to take your order - you have to go to the bar yourself. The fitness room is by the pool and separated by glass (leading to the pool). It's clean with towels, but there is no air conditioning and only 3 pieces of equipment. Overall a brilliant hotel!

It was too far for us to walk to the city centre but cheap taxis were easily available at the hotel. The hop on hop off bus stops a short distance from the back of the hotel. The buffet breakfast was superb with a great range of food and an egg station. We found the hotel's bar prices rather high so tended to go down to the promenade in front of the hotel for our pre dinner drinks and evening meals. Reception were very helpful and booked us on the sightseeing bus and a guided tour to Puerto Pollensa and Alcudia (well worth doing). They can also arrange car hire.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/417","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/312"},{"id":1331,"date":"2015-07-14T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"Great hotel, enjoyed a relaxing long weekend with my friend and it was everything we both needed. Excellent service, great food, amazingly hot weather, plenty of sunloungers and good location. Great Clarins toiletries in the room, lovely breakfast choices including fizz (I do like a Buck's Fizz at breakfast when on hols), nothing was too much trouble for the waiters. Staff cleaned the pool daily, lifeguards really friendly v comfy sun beds. We were only there for a long weekend so didn't have dinner in the hotel although based on the quality of the breakfast I assume it would have been at a similar standard. Cannot wait to go again!

I wasn't impressed by the location as the main entrance is off a rather run down street. The back was nicer as it was on the marina but it was a fairly long, hot walk to all the major attractions. My room was more than adequate and looked like it had been recently updated. The view was grim but I didn't pay for a sea view so I was stuck looking at concrete. I like to work out first thing in the morning but I couldn't use the tiny gym because it was out by the pool and didn't open until 10am and breakfast (which I'd paid for in my room rate) was served 7.30-10.30 so time was not on my side. The breakfast was nice but I would not have paid the 29 that was quoted on the menu. The view from the breakfast room and balcony was lovely and one of the best things about the hotel. I'm very glad I wasn't there high season as the hotel is literally right beside Tito's a very popular nightclub. I did hear some noise a couple of times in my room at night but luckily it seemed to be people walking by the back of the hotel so it didn't last long. The pool was nice- lots of loungers. The staff were fairly friendly on the whole. I had room service once and it was of good quality. I didn't like the 4.50 service charge to bring it to my room and then having the guy hanging there expecting a tip. They charge for practically everything. No water in room on arrival and I was thirsty!!","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/756","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/590"},{"id":1348,"date":"2014-11-19T00:00:00Z","rating":2,"comment":"Hotel was well below our expectations. We wanted to celebrate our anniversary at a nice hotel in Mallorca but it was subpar at best. Hotel is decorated with antique furniture which made the hotel and the rooms smell pretty bad. They also used this very heavy fragrance which made staying at all common areas, such as lobby or bars, quite unbearable. To make things worse, there was a post in the middle of the room which made moving around difficult in a small room. The hotel told us that we had to pay extra in order to change the room as that was the only room available for the price that we paid. One can probably find a much better hotel for the price you pay for this hotel. Service can certainly improve as well. Location is quite awkward as well. It's about 40 minute walk to the city centre and it's not close to the beaches either. Unfortunately, I don't have anything nice to say about this hotel.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/244","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/415"},{"id":1349,"date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","rating":3,"comment":"Location was superb - very easy to walk into the old town.

I travelled with my elderly mother and although the hotel has a lot of steps she was able to manage well. Staff are universally friendly and helpful. There is a small selection of bar meals which was very good. The cost of food and drinks is very reasonable considering the surroundings and service. We never ate dinner in the main restaurant but the breakfast had an excellent choice everything from full cooked English to fresh fruit, natural local yoghurt and lots of cereals or pastries. The Cava on ice was a nice touch. The rooms are modern but with an old world charm, from the1930s () marble style bathrooms to solid wood writing desks and comfortable arm chairs. Comfortable beds, plenty of hot water and wifi in the rooms. Overall the decor and furnishing in this hotel speaks of solid old fashioned quality in a modern well-run establishment. Sure if you look at your feet as you walk, you will see the odd threadbare carpet in the corridors but it completely fits with the feel of a well-loved lived in country mansion that isn polished from top to bottom daily. The lay-out of the public areas around the foyer was very homely.....arranged in such a way with plants, rugs and large pieces of antique () furniture that each section felt like your own private sitting room and even when the hotel was busy, it never felt crowded.

Towels and wash cloths were very rough and thin. You can see the outside through the bottom of the door to your room. Nothing continental about the breakfast.

The room was extremely small and was not the one I booked per the picture.

Though the breakfast was varied and they do speak English, they could not make (regardless of language spoken), I am fluent in 2 and also speak some italian, they could not figure out how to make scrambled eggs!! Oh they had them, the ones you make from powder. Anywho, the staff is kind of uptight, though they play it like if they are actually being friendly. Other than that, and the extreme price 350 per night, the hotel was exceptionally well located. Train station and Duomo and Piazzas are all like 3 minutes to 5 away in each direction.

The younger female consierge was very helpful in contrast. The hotel lobby is large, elegant, and the hotel bar, bartender, were fantastic. The aperitivo was mostly breads with various topping, but good. The room itself, for a superior, was stuffy, overpriced, the bed was worn and too soft, the bathroom way too small for one person let along two people to move around in at the same time. Had to take the toilet paper off the roll to keep it dry while showering, water went everywhere. The refrigerator needed to be defrosted so wasn't cooling properly, which we used to keep our bottled water cool. Didn't need the mini bar so moved some things out to make room.

Someone came and changed the filter which was black is was so dirty, and did something else but nothing changed. The staff was very friendly, but I think that is just Italians. One afternoon we asked for a breakfast to go because we had an early adventure, they said they couldn't do it. We went down earlier another day thinking they opened and they were setting up, but they would let us take a couple of croissants, even though those were out. He did let us go in 10 minutes early when he realized we waiting. The breakfast room was so hot it was almost to much to stay to eat. But the breakfast spread was good. (We travel a lot and have never had a hotel not accommodate that.) The location is excellent. Easy walk to most parts of the city as well as the train station. They did arrange a day trip for us. Asked for a late departure and they said no, even though our housekeeping did come to our room until 4:00 the day before. On the last day a couple of the girls finally started to loosen up when my husband was joking around with them, and when we got back to our room a little while later they called and have given us our late check out.

The hotel is an older property, and still maintained nicely. The hotel doesn't have a door person to open the door for you or greet you.

We stayed during first 2 weeks in November. Air conditioning had been turned off and our room and daughter's room were too hot. Hotel didn't have fans. Windows had no screens, so opening them to cool off the rooms let in mosquitoes. This was probably not an unusual problem since rooms had plug in insect repellent units. Maid service was excellent. All in all, the hotel was expensive, but worth it. The junior suite was well appointed.

After he proposed, we knew we wanted to have our wedding there. We had to book it over a year in advance because we wanted the last Saturday in April, but it was definitely worth the wait. Lisa, the in-house wedding concierge, was fantastic to work with. The food was absolutely spectacular, and it was served family-style instead of buffet, so none of our guests had to wait and watch while other guests got their food. The only downside was that we had to end the reception at 11pm, even though we would have loved to keep the party going.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/850","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/858"},{"id":1756,"date":"2013-12-06T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"I love Sabrina Watts who originally booked my wedding.

Initially, it was difficult to get a hold of someone to set up tours and discuss booking, but I believe this was because the staff was in flux at the time. Once Sabrina began handling our event, it was smooth sailing. Sabrina was very patient while my fiance and I went over the contract with a fine-toothed comb. She was able to address all of our concerns, answered all of our questions, and was very accommodating. When we booked the venue, we knew we had chosen the right place.Our day of coordinator was Michelle who was top-notch. I first met her at our menu tasting; she's charming, kind, and knowledgeable. I felt I could ask her the smallest/stupidest questions. I did most of the planning long-distance so prompt e-mails were important to me. Michelle and I were able to communicate most things through e-mail, and she did a great job making sure I didn't forget anything. On the day of the wedding, I honestly did not worry about a thing. I had such a wonderful time and it's because Michelle took care of everything. She helped make it an event to remember.My guests were impressed with the decor at the Citizen - I had many compliments on how beautiful and elegant the setting was. The terrace, along with the Capitol Building in the background, is breathtaking. I heard many people say that the food was fantastic, and one person said it was the best wedding food he's ever had. The guests also loved how each room is unique. The Reservations Manager, Megan, was also very easy to work with and allowed me to change many things, even at the last minute. We were in the Governor's Suite for the wedding, and the room is, of course, fabulous.My only critiques would be that there is no free wi-fi, but you can sign up for the Joy of Life Club and get free wi-fi that way. Parking can also be a concern, especially if you are part of the wedding party and need to go to and fro. But we all managed. Overall, we couldn't have been happier with our wedding and feel the Citizen Hotel did a fantastic job.

He wrote the book How Great Companies get their Mojo from Maslow. The Citizen Hotel helped move me a bit up the pyramid, but being in Sacramento couldn't fully bring me to self-actualization. Oh well, can't have everything. It's an old downtown bank turned boutique hotel with dark reds and blacks and great drawings and political cartoons along the wall. The best is the black and white pic of a young buff Arnold Schwarzenegger, shirtless and in speedos, flexing with a group of bridesmaids in the women's bathroom in the parlor. The room was spacious, swanky, sophisticated. Dripping with old school charm and modern day luxuries. An Apple-lovers haven -- iPhone docks, macs in the business center. Dual shower heads, decent products, sitting room with a second flat screen TV (although I learned I had the ADA room). Steamer instead of an iron (LOVE), roomy, cozy, great bed, decent mini-bar.

There was not a single mistake made, which is no small task when we had so many requests and last minute changes. She also conducted our rehearsal, which took so much weight off my shoulders the day before when I was about to crack! The serving staff also went above and beyond to make sure we got to enjoy dinner and they even left champagne and left overs in our room for us to enjoy after the wedding was over.As for the venue itself, it really speaks for itself. The tented 7th floor terrace with a view of the capitol is exquisite to the point that minimal decorations are necessary. The food is local and sustainable and tasted every bit as good as during our tasting at the Grange. The food at the cocktail hour got especially rave reviews. The hotel put guests with children on the same floor as the terrace, so some families put their kids to bed and then were able to return to the reception to dance! The bell staff was also extremely helpful over and over with all of our stuff and multiple cars going in and out of valet.

The T.V. only had about four channels and the water in the shower was barely warm. The outside looked fairly nice except they had two pedestals, one at each doorway, to put cigarettes out in and they clearly had not been emptied in quite a long time. Even as a long time smoker, this was quite unpleasant and smelly. I like that the cigarette disposals were available when I went outside for an occasional cigarette, however, the fact that they were not emptied in a while and the fact that they were swimming in rain water from earlier in the day, was off putting even to me. Next time I go to Ithaca, I may have to stay there again if there are no other hotels within my budget. Do I think it was worth the money No!

Around 6:45 in the morning heard gurgling sounds from the bathroom. I went to check it out and found sewage coming up through the shower and toilet that wouldn't flush. Soon it became apparent that this is happening through the entire hotel, not just our room. Plumber was called, but no shower, no bathroom and no breakfast due to breakfast are being flooded. We left for the day and when we returned at night we found that the sewage backup has been cleared but no one cleaned the bathroom or made the room afterward. So we ended up CLEANING THE SHOWER TUB OURSELVES in order to be ready for dinner in time. When we confronted the staff bout it, the guy behind the desk offered to send a cleaning crew, which we declined because it was too late. And then for some reason the lady behind him got an attitude and started telling us it's our fault that the room wasn't cleaned because *she* thought we already checked out. Why she thought that when all our stuff was still in the room that we prepaid for, she couldn't say. We went on to find out that TV and the iron did not work. The worst part of all this is that they refused to make ANY of this right, told us to take up our complaints with Hotels.com. Hotels.com couldn't care less, offered us some symbolic discount which I turned down.

We stayed there for 3 nights. Our room was conveniently located in the first floor with 2 doors, one to the hall inside the hotel and one to our parked car. VERY convenient.There was an old tube TV, which distorted the picture at times. But it didn't bother us too much. We were gone during the day and only spend night hours in the room. The two queen beds were very convenient as well. Big bathroom with lots of space on the vanity. The paint on the ceiling was peeling off and the wall in general needed a little touch up. We used the pool. It was very clean, however, but a little to cool for my comfort. There was friendly service. Breakfast was nothing special, the usual breakfast bar.

The breakfast in the restaurant was about the worst I have ever had, and the price made it even harder to swallow. JUST GROSS- we had the buffet. We chose Bay City only because my husband wanted to book a NICE HOTEL which now seems like a huge mistake. I have traveled all around the US and stay in various hotels.

I didn't notice it until I pull the white sheet to check the bed. They didn't change our pillow sheet at all. I wouldn't get mad if it was a cheap hotel. I paid 125 dollar a night for that room and they have the audacity to not change my bed sheet. I was so embarrass for bringing my girl to this hotel. The picture look good online, but when you get to the hotel, it's a different ball game. The room is not that large, compare to the picture. They didn't even have a microwave in the room.

It was my first time in West Palm Beach. I was barely impressed with this hotel, being a large name brand, I expected more. The room was centrally located near the airport and highways which was great, thankfully we decided to rent a car because there was no scenery or activities to do near the hotel. The outside and lobby was pretty, very similar to other business hotels. I was extremely dissapointed upon check in when we realized the hotel pool was not only not in service, but it was completely empty. That was the only reason we booked this hotel was for the pool so again we had to drive to even swim on our family vacation. The room was mediocre, similar to a stay at our local hotels in the north east. The breakfast was over priced 15 per person for a breakfast buffet. Overall I would suggest not staying here while on vacation unless you are fully aware in order to do anything fun you must drive there. Also be sure to call before you check in to be sure the pool is in service. For the amount that was spend which was almost 150 per night I think we could have found a better place for our first family trip with our daughter. Good luck hope this helps.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/300","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/783"},{"id":2375,"date":"2013-06-14T00:00:00Z","rating":3,"comment":"for a smoke free facility, room smelled like smoke, even worse when the ac was turned on.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/543","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/236"},{"id":2376,"date":"2015-10-30T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"It was excellent!

I expected a more higher class of hotel. It does not hold up to what a Hilton used to be. This hotel did not have a TV guide in the room nor on the TV screen for guests to know what was playing in Florida. That was the biggest complaint. There was a list of stations, such as, ABC, NBC, HGTV, etc. That was all in the room. When I called down for assistance, I was told that that was all the hotel had to offer. I also expected a better quality of coffee maker. The staff was excellent however. Overall, I will not put hotels bought out by Hilton on my list of places to stay in the future.

I explained my dilemma and although I was extremely early they did their best to get a room available and gave me directions to the t-mobile store so I could get a replacement phone. By the time I returned the room was ready and the woman who checked me in had a message from my wife and she read it aloud to me in such a nice way. I was really impressed by the welcome and all the help. The room was nicely decorated and I was just looking to take a shower and relax a bit before I went to meet up with some friends. And there it was... black mold in the shower. Clearly visible and of course once I saw it I looked under some of the fixtures in the shower and found a lot more. Gross. Other than that the room was basically very comfortable. Air conditioning worked well. Television worked well. Free WiFi was a treat. Outlets galore for your cell phones, tablets, laptops etc. Really efficient room. Pool was nice. Fitness room was clean and modern facilities. It was so difficult to actually get someone to assist you in the restaurant that I walked out twice and found someplace else to eat. That and the black mold were the only negative aspects. I would definitely stay there again. Oh and the self parking made for easy mobility if you rent a car.

If they did some updates in the rooms and made a few little changes, the prices they charge would be justified. Good things: decent location, quiet neighborhood, not too far from the city. Annoying things: the wifi is pretty bad during the day, the rooms are dated, the bed was pretty darn bad, their version of a continental breakfast consists of low-grade muffins and coffee, and they make you check out at 11am and don't allow late check-outs. I called for an extension I was willing to pay for and they said no. I travel a lot, and that was a first. This place advertises dishes and cutlery for your room (they have kitchens), but none was supplied. In my opinion, all those things arent too bad, but more so inconveniences. That's all I have.

There are 2 floors and nowhere in the hotel is even 1 elevator, stairs only. Very irritating to haul several pieces of luggage up and down stairs. On the first night, went down the stairway to our car and there was popcorn spilled all over the steps. When we left after our 2nd night there, the popcorn was still there, even though we told them about it. Unacceptable!","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/481","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/127"},{"id":2715,"date":"2015-01-19T00:00:00Z","rating":3,"comment":"It was a nice hotel, but they are in the middle of remodeling so it was hard to move around the parking lot and supplies in the hallway.

His knowledge will enhance your understanding and appreciation for some of the wonderful things he has collected for everyone's enjoyment. And what a wonderful property - the views, the trees, the animals and birds! We loved sitting outside taking it all in. There is so much to see and do in the surrounding area as well. Patagonia with its railroad history was so quaint and interesting. We loved touring the country side and the wineries.

We stayed in the Oriental room in the main house. It was a little small but we reserved it because it was the only one available for a one-night stay. It was very comfortable, despite the size, and the food was wonderful. Staff makes breakfast whenever you want, kind of an unusual feature, and one I appreciate because I tend to get up early and don't like to wait til 9 to eat. This is a great Inn for birders, you can see lots of birds without even leaving the patio! It is a couple miles outside of Patagonia, but easy to find.

Smart since the beds were absolutely terrible. All three of them rolled you right into the middle! Super uncomfortable! What's the 3-queen suite you ask A 2-queen suite with the sofa, chair, coffee table removed and a 3rd bed put in leaving one chair for the everyone to fight over at the desk. The bathroom had to be the smallest I've ever been in with a stand-up shower that had a curtain too short leaving the floor a mess when done. The shower head wasn't centered on the shower which added to the mess. The continental breakfast was an absolute joke! A couple of varieties of cold muffins/pastries, 2 kinds of cereal, weak coffee, and one waffle maker that everyone waited in line for. The man behind the counter was extremely nice the evening we arrived. That was a plus. I think the cleaning crew picked our room to eat their Indian take-out as it smelled like curry when we returned that evening! Can't think of another reason as none of the cleaning crew looked of Indian decent. I know we went to Durango right in the midst of vacation season, but the old saying, You get what you paid for rang true at the hit of 125/night. We could/should have stayed at a much newer hotel and been a bit more cramped for the same money! Spend a little more or a little less and step up to one of the nicer motels. You won't regret it!

My first complaint was the price for what was given. I am sure that because of the high demand in this market, prices are based on supply and demand. Having said this, I was prepared to pay a higher price for the two nights we stayed. However, there is no excuse for a room that had dead bugs on the window sills and hair in the bathtub. These were not cleaned out between the two days of our stay. After seeing the dead bugs in the bathroom window, i found evidence of more dead bugs in the room. With this, I felt like the room was not being cleaned properly and only made us doubt the cleanliness of the room for the remainder of our stay. Also, I found a large bite on my right arm after the first night. I am almost certain this happened in the room on our first night. The TV was an older type of TV, not the more modern version flat screen. That was not a particular problem as much as that the TV did not even work. We were told that the remote was probably the problem so they traded it out for a new one and that also did not work. So for two nights we had no TV. Again, I was prepared to pay the higher cost but in this case felt like I was taken advantage of. There is no excuse for this kind of customer treatment.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/62","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/329"},{"id":2798,"date":"2016-07-07T00:00:00Z","rating":2,"comment":"WiFi was extremely slow and bogged down.

The amount of noise from the rooms around us was incredible. The next morning we asked to move to a room where a guest had checked out-again we were told none were available. After returning to our room we received a call saying one was avail and we could move rooms immediately. Since this was first thing in the morning it tells me that this room was avail when we checked in. If you want a quiet hotel, DON'T stay here. When a door from a room closes or when someone walks heavy in the hall or in their room, the entire building shakes it can be heard loudly in the room next door below. There was a baseball team with kids that appeared to be 10 yrs old staying here and running wild. The noise and floor/building rattling from a baseball team running up and down the hallways was very disturbing. The parents not once told the kids to stop running. It was really sad the lack of respect being shown to other guests. We talked to the front desk and they told us that it is not their place to say anything to the kids. Yes it is!! It is up to you to ensure the comfort of all your guests and if kids are being too loud and parents aren't around, you can tell the kids to stop running in the halls and to be quiet. The hotel was loud, beds pillows were uncomfortable, the breakfast was less than average. Will we stay at a Best Western Plus again, yes. Will we stay at this location,NEVER!","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/51","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/961"},{"id":2906,"date":"2016-04-01T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"Pretty nice hotel close to ATT stadium and Six Flags Over Texas. They offer a free shuttle to the stadium but charged us for going to Six Flags... Which doesn't make much sense since they are both about the same distance from the hotel. The room had a fridge and a separate sitting area which was nice. The bed was standard which for us wasn't very comfortable. They offered a free breakfast with eggs, sausage, waffles and for two days they had potatoes but didn't on the last day. They also had the standard cereal, yogurt, etc. The hotel is right next to a Jack in The Box and across the highway from and IHOP.

The TV had a few basic channels, standard HBO was Spanish only, but that was fine. The pool is clean and centrally located. I loved that it offered free stay for our dog, but there is almost zero places to walk your dog so they may do their business. The only places were a few gravel medians and side areas, but it worked out okay. The location isn't great - not much to walk to directly next to the hotel, but a 8 minute drive does get you to Reid Park.

Ventilation was poor in the room, windows didn't open and no fan in the bathroom, so I wasn't able to air out the room. The room itself was partially updated, but paint peeling in other areas. Bathrooms were old, small and dingy and no bath towels were provided, only hand towels and wash cloths. Service at the front desk was adequate and the breakfast looked decent.Hotel was pet friendly. I would suggest that possibly they could reserve different floors for people not staying with pets, so they are not disturbed at all hours by barking dogs in neighboring rooms (as I was).","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/382","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/490"},{"id":2966,"date":"2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"Nice size rooms and clean.

Our room was not ready so we had to come back at 4:30. The beds are not good quality, too firm. The shower was not clean, it had mold in it and a couple of short hairs on the plastic enclosure walls. the breakfast is nothing to write home about. They do have waffles you can make but no fruit at all except some bananas. Not horrible by any means, our room was fairly quiet, but I won't be back.

The beds were comfortable, too, although more pillow options would have been even better. I like a softer pillow than what was offered, but that's my own preference. We also had some trouble with the room air conditioning system, mostly due to the remote used to operate it, which seemed simple enough and we had thought we had things running properly, until we were awakened in the night due to the room being way too stuffy. That's when we discovered the remote had a hidden flap with more buttons that we randomly pressed until the A/C fan turned on. Sometimes being high-tech can be a problem, especially without instructions. A little card in the room to explain things would have been very helpful. The hotel was nicely maintained and the lobby was warm and inviting, with friendly staff. The breakfast was yummy with a few hot options (sausage, eggs and waffles) as well as the usual breads, cereals and pastries.

However, the Air Conditioner made so much noise when it turned off and on that it continually awakened us throughout both nights of our stay. Therefore, our sleep was continually interrupted.

The desk staff is very pleasant, the courtyard when you walk up is cute. The room is a nightmare. I wish I could add photos. The only chair was very wobbly, we never sat on it. When I sat up against the headboard, my shirt stuck to it. The kitchen had huge cracks radiating out all over the wall. The bathroom ceiling had little mold spots over the shower as there was no ventilation. The toilet seat used to be white, but was worn down to the wooden base in most spots. The white shelf over the bathroom sink was literally shredding apart. It looked like an asbestos base that had been soaking in water for a year. It was literally puffing up from inside out. It was a cheap place to stay, but not so cheap that they can't fix basic problems. The neighborhood is right by the key arena.

We live a little under an hour away, so we were just coming up for the evening. We called early in the day to inquire about parking and were told that the Inn had their own parking lot so it was no problem to pay to park when we arrived later. Well, when we checked in we were told the parking lot was full, sorry. I was shocked and disappointed that no other explanation or assitance was given. The lady at reception simply handed me a map of some nearby lots and suggested we just park on the street. Well, good luck finding street parking on a Friday evening! We drove around for over an hour until we could find a spot. We then had to move our car in the morning before the race. This was a huge inconvenience. We stopped by hotel reception after driving around for an hour to inquire about late check-out. We were told the hotel doesn't offer late check-out, and even after explaining our frustration about driving around for an hour (or more) looking for parking, she simply said, there's nothing I can do. We were very disappointed in the lack of service, lack of genuine apology, and absence of any sort of gesture for our inconvenience. Needless to say, we will not be back.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/509","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/647"},{"id":3238,"date":"2016-05-15T00:00:00Z","rating":3,"comment":"Other hotels in the area were MUCH pricier than this one.

We returned to our room at night, after being out all day, and found the door wasn't securely shut and gave way to a simple push. Panicked, we took inventory of our possessions and luckily discovered nothing missing. I hate to think of what may have happened if an intruder entered the room and my wife returned alone. After informing the front desk, I wrote an email to the gen mngr and got a reply from their op mngr the next day. She informed me that our room had been accessed by keycards that were issued at check-in. I informed her that there was no way that we could have accessed our room during the times she gave me. She couldnt offer an explanation of how or why our door lock showed access. While we were away I know that staff had entered to clean so its safe to assume that it was staff who left the door unlocked/open. Again, a simple push opened the door so a simple push by staff to check if the door was securely shut would have sufficed to ensure our safety. Since we were offered no real explanation of why our door wasnt securely shut that night, I do not recommend staying at this Marriott location if you value your safety and the safety of your belongings. If you do find yourself here, before using your keycard when returning each night, try giving the door a push and see if it opens up.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/335","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/450"},{"id":3362,"date":"2015-03-24T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"Fantastic service, great rooms, very clean, a full breakfast, nice patio area.

He had to ask for help, which is fine, but it took forever and this incident came back to haunt us. The carpet was disgustingly filthy in our room! We all had black dirt and grime under our feet after only 2 hours of being in the room! The dishes in the cupboards were all dirty. ALL of them! It was so gross. There was dried food on everything. Check out was a nightmare for my mother. The two people working the front desk at check-in did not swipe our credit cards correctly and there was no record of my card ever being swiped. Which is INSANE because we actually saw them do it! At this point my family and I were already on an airplane home, so my poor mom had to check out alone and deal with this. They put the entire cost of the room on her credit card because there was no record of my card. We aren't a rich family. We saved for a very long time to afford this trip and in one swipe this Residence Inn completely ruined my mother financially. Even after admitting it was their mistake the hotel manager never offered my mother any sort of consolation. No discount, no coupon for a future stay, nothing. They just shrugged their shoulders.

I immediately went downstairs to inform the woman at the check in, apparently the room wasn't suppose to be in use they moved me into another room. Everything looked fine UNTIL my 3 year old son was wearing black shorts and socks and had sat on the floor only to get up and have his whole bottom and socks covered in WHITE FUR. I turned on all the lights and DISCOVERED that the carpet was covered in what seemed to be dog or cat fur, my mother in law and I looked at each other and noticed our clothes were covered in it too as well as our luggage. Once again I went downstairs as we were leaving for dinner asking the front desk if there was anyway to send someone to at least vacuum the room or to get me the vacuum so I do it, she said house keeping was gone and they could possibly send me one when I came back. I didn't get the vacuum and the next morning my mother in law woke up with a SWOLLEN face and itchy throat (she is MILDLY ALLERGIC to animal fur but thats how much fur was in the room that it caused her to have a SEVERE allergic reaction).

The wallpaper next to the table where we sat for breakfast had grease stains on it.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/489","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/987"},{"id":3469,"date":"2014-09-19T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"F��r unsere Zwecke ausreichend, da nur Zwischenaufenthalt f��r eine Nacht.

I got into town from out of state very late & exhausted. Front desk attendant was nice but wreaked of cigarette smoke-GROSS! I had to leave early b4 breakfast that morning then was comming back b4 checkout & I got no food saved & I was starving! No food was available the night b4 either. Someone had unplugged lights & moved heavy bed flush against wall so I could fix them myself either. I called front desk because I didn't have any lights by bed only across room & they said oh well I'll call maintenance tomorrrow. Great, for $130-hotel sucked! I easily could've paid $10 & stayed @ a 4-star hotel king suite w/ a whirlpool in my room yet I chose this hotel & for as much money as it was, it was so NOT worth it. This Holiday in should simply be cheaper being that after high initial cost they expect u to pay for breakfast too.

It had been five years since we last booked a room there and we went with Holiday Inn again because they were priced slightly lower than the other hotels nearby and because we had always had a positive experience before. We were not disappointed this time either. The entire property had been redone and tastefully redecorated. Our room had also been redecorated including the bathroom which had granite countertops and new shower fixtures. We ate dinner in the restaurant which was very nicely decorated. The menu offered a nice variety and although the food was not outstanding, it was good enough. My only complaint was that the service was a bit slow at check in and in the restaurant.

Machine was broke so it was left that way. It leaked all over the tea and coffee packets. Ice machine was broke on our floor. The hallways were dirty and had not been vacuumed and also had stains.

The first night I was put in a room that had very recently been smoked in. This is a non-smoking hotel. But they didn't really seem surprised and/or concerned that someone had disregarded this little rule. The second night I stayed, I was in a room that had the smoke alarm covered in black electrical tape...presumably so someone could smoke. The room was clean and there was no smell. But it's a bit disturbing knowing that they clearly hadn't looked at or tested the smoke alarm in the recent past. Otherwise, it's a Comfort Inn. It could be better, but it's an ok place to rest your head. The neighborhood is nice and there was no noise from the highway.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/96","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/296"},{"id":3649,"date":"2014-03-07T00:00:00Z","rating":3,"comment":"I was disappointed that the indoor pool was not in service.

I had to again carry my infant son back down the front desk, and he was awoken from his nap because of this. The TV did not work the second evening I stayed here.

First of all, let me start with the group of surly men who camp out each evening in front of the hotel drink beer. Management took no mind. After that it took a while for the desk clerk to appear and check us in. GENERAL: All of the hall carpets throughout the motel hallways look like someone or something had motor oil diarrhea from one end to another. Big black stains up and down. Likewise, all of the walls in the hallway had black skid marks up and down. OUR ROOM: Third floor no internet and they know it. Also, ice machine broken on 3rd. Carpets in room - filthy. Don't look in the corners of the bathroom. Just don't. Bed was ok, but the spread on top was questionable in cleanliness. BREAKFAST: Scrambled eggs, no breakfast meat as advertised, biscuits gravy -ok, cereal, bagels, toast, Danish. Not as advertised. OVERALL: General feeling of uncleanliness uneasiness throughout the stay (the drinking gang and local area). Poor quality service, poor attention to details, terrible management.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/204","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/596"},{"id":3667,"date":"2013-07-15T00:00:00Z","rating":3,"comment":"Receptionist very good.

Went on a long motorcycle ride, and just wanted to find a place to lay my head. That's about all it was good for. The first room they gave us was dirty... bed unmade, trash everywhere, etc. We went to the front desk and the lady working was very sorry and very nice, but didn't seem to know where to put us. We are smokers and wanted a smoking room. They didn't have any smoking rooms left, but the owner handed us an ashtray and said...view more it's a smoking room now. I wouldn't mind smoking outside if they didn't have any smoking rooms left, but when I got to the room, I understood why he didn't mind giving us the ashtray. The carpet was atrocious and when I went to take a shower, the handle to turn the water on came off in my hand. The tiles were missing all over the bathroom, the toilet looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years. They advertise coffee makers and alarm clocks. Not only did we not have either, there was no remote to the TV either. The smell in the room made me think they had just removed a corpse or something as equally bad. They make you pay in advance and there is no refund, now I know why. They advertise that they have the largest indoor pool in Iowa, however it has been closed for years for improvements.

I lodged a complaint about broken furniture that might have caused me an injury. The owner implied that perhaps I broke the furniture. It was a sofa bed in the front room of the suite. I was charged 120.00 for the suite. When I checked in, I was told there was wet bar. When I got in the room, there was nothing, but an empty refrigerator and cabinets, which is not the definition of a hotel wet bar. When I sat on the bed, ...view morethe frame broke. When I tried to get out, it broke again. My roommate had to come and help me get out of thebed. Then the bed could not be put back in the couch. I have had a hip replacement. Sitting on that sofa bed with a broken frame that fell in could have caused damage to my hip. And, that was not all the curtains in the room were too short to cover the entire window so there was light in the room all night. The last straw was that the room had a hair dryer that would not stay on while in use. I had to hold the on button to use the dryer, which made it totally useless. Our stay was not a good experience. I have stayed in Best Western Hotels all over the US and never used one with this many problems. When I asked for a reduction in my charge, I was given only a 20, instead of a no charge for the room. I would not have been so disgruntled had the owner, Sarah Patel, given me a free night, but she did not. The hotel furniture was dangerous, did not have the wet bar that it promised, and did not have appropriate window coverings. Sarah Patel, owner of the establishment, provided (1) poor services, (2) unsafe equipment and (3) inoperable appliances. Her business tarnishes the image of Best Western Hotel International and the city of Tracy.view less","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/161","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/671"},{"id":3769,"date":"2008-10-02T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"This Best Western is just the place to go to get away!

The room was a bit small, but very clean. We didn't go to stay in the room anyway. The t.v. was smaller than some as well and somewhat limited, and the internet was not so great in our corner, but we didn't go to stay in the room. There was a nice sized fridge, coffee maker, full-sized hair dryer and great shower head with great linens and grooming products. The Holiday Inn was conveniently just outside the Canyon and very close to Chinle. Native Guides are waiting in the Hotel if you want to go into the canyon. Guided trips vary from 3 hours to 6 hours, and the type of vehicle varies as well. My family went in a closed (vs. No windows, open-sided) Suburban which offered protection from the elements and a bit more comfort. Ask for Harold and his family. My family was impressed with H.'s knowledge of the canyon history, etc. He graciously answered many questions. We went into town for dinner even though the dinner special was steak for under 15. Our breakfast was very good with large portions. So one would expect the dinners to be likewise. The ladies in the gift shop were helpful and check-out was easy.

They refused to refund me for the night I did not use. It does state this in their bi laws, but to tell the truth, this has never happened to me before so I did not look. MY experience is it is typical for hotels to refund canceled reservations if they are 36 hours in advance. What right has a hotel to do refuse to refund w sufficient notice. That should not be legal. Would you buy clothes or tools at a shop that had no refund policy They do it because they know they are only one of two hotels in this impoverished little town. Do yourself a favor, stay an hour away in Kayenta, at Monument Valley. There's no night life in Chinle so its not like you need to be around in the evening. Also their restaurant was extremely expensive, so we did not eat there. We ate at a Chinese resturaunt on the main road. The food was typical, but the staff were fun to be around. Canyon De Chelly, however, is incredible. Don't miss that.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/475","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/214"},{"id":3880,"date":"2010-05-22T00:00:00Z","rating":2,"comment":"Beware - no alcohol in the restaurant.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/307","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/746"},{"id":3881,"date":"2016-09-06T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"Loved the pool and sitting on balcony.

Since I was not happy about that, he then checked to see what he could do and found a room with a king bed. Kudos to him for that but the room must have had pets in it previously because every time I stood still on the carpet, something would bite me. I assume it must have been fleas so rather than go through the hassle of changing rooms, I did not stand still on the carpet and thankfully the critters didn't follow me home. I told the girl at the desk about the issue so hopefully the room was properly cleaned and treated. Shame on the pet owners who bring their bug infested pets into a hotel room making it worse for the next guest.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/271","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/706"},{"id":4119,"date":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"Hotel was nice overall but we had an issue with our tv remote.

The bus was small and very comfortable, reclining seats, air conditioning, lots of leg room and space for day packs. Anything bigger just couldn't get to the places we visited; along tiny, twisting Irish back roads (So glad I didn't drive). The guide/driver was a fountain of knowledge, treating everyone as his new best friend. Stories and info flowed easily and I never felt like I was receiving a lecture. We could stop anytime we wanted for a photo and we had plenty of time at sites; we just all sauntered back to the bus when we were ready.

Fortunately the hotel had a room for the second night, just not the same room. The first night our room faced the street, so there was traffic noise with the window open. The next night we faced the parking lot. The bed in the first room was like sleeping on a rock. We like a firm mattress, but this was ridiculous. The second night, the bed was much better, firm without being rock-hard. That room was huge with two king beds and a sofa bed. It could have very comfortably slept 6 people without feeling crowded. Both rooms had a microwave, refrigerator, and coffee maker. The bathrooms were also large, and the second room had a spa tub. During the stay I interacted with four different employees--all very pleasant. Breakfast was good, the usual cereals, yogurt, fruit, waffles, muffins, juice, coffee. The first day they had hard-boiled eggs, but the second day they were out. I missed the protein. There were several restaurants nearby, but we didn't go to any of them so I don't have a recommendation. The parking lot is fairly small, so if you have a large vehicle I would suggest parking in a place where you'll be able to get out easily. Our only complaint was the very poor internet service. The desk clerk gave us an Ethernet cord, but that didn't help. We were here midweek, and the price was reasonable.

The room was huge for the price. I've spent more at smaller places. We had a deluxe King and it was bigger than a studio. Very nice and clean. Wish the tv would have been a bit bigger considering how big the space was. It was a bit hard to see from the couch. There was some remodeling upgrades being done so my only complaints were the strong stench of paint paint thinner in the halls, However, a slight oversight considering it's for repairs. Also the ice machine on our floor was out of service so we had to go all the way to the lobby every time. Both the day and evening clerk were very nice. We had food delivered to the room because it was storming but there were tons of places to chose from. Less than 10 minutes from the beach. Wish there were places near home as nice because I stay in hotels often between work and travel. I would absolutely stay there again. I slept almost a whole day it was so peaceful. I have family in Monterey who stay about 5 minutes from the hotel so this place will definitely be my go to when I'm in town.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/144","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/202"},{"id":4378,"date":"2008-10-05T00:00:00Z","rating":null,"comment":"Budget-conscious travelers enjoy a free, daily continental breakfast and newspaper at this worldwide chain famous for comfort.

The staff was friendly and helpful they quickly fixed our sink which was found to be leaking when we checked in. The facility is showing a little wear and could be cleaner, but it wasn't filthy like some other Super 8 locations I've frequented. Our room was sufficiently clean. The biggest draw for us was the price and the location for a short stay. The neighborhood is quiet there are no residential neighborhoods right next to the property. There's an Aldi grocery store across the street if you need snacks or other food items. The basic breakfast was nice for a quick bite before leaving there was yogurt, toast, cinnamon rolls, muffins and even waffles. The only complaint that I have has nothing to do with the motel or staff it was the guests. A bunch of high-school or college age punks were staying there too and created lots of noise and disturbances they behaved like the place was their dorm or frat house. Eventually management got them to quiet down but I think that they should have called the local police and had them forcefully ejected from the premises.

You literally had to yank up on the door to get the latch to catch, and then to turn the deadbolt I would have to hold the door up, by the handle, with both hands while my niece turned the dead bolt knob. There was not chain latch because it was broken.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/364","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/777"},{"id":4425,"date":"2015-04-25T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"Clean and comfortable.

The return trip was always exhausting and I often felt like I was still on the roller coasters when I was driving through Pittsburgh. This time I decided to make reservations, and the Super 8 Monroeville was an affordable option that provided a decent place to rest for the night. I stayed on a Tuesday night and there was plenty of parking. If you are not a fussy person and just need a quiet place to rest for one night, this motel is suitable. A light breakfast is provided in the morning.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/880","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/729"},{"id":4428,"date":"2016-09-08T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"Only complaint would be the unavailability of an ADA room, made bathing very difficult for my wife.

We sat outside looking up at the tree covered canyon walls and there was a lovely breeze with fresh air as the sun went down. The next day we drove to Wildlife Safari near bye and were amazed by all of the animals and heartened by their cheetah breeding program. The clean cafe in the Wildlife Safari village was a pleasant surprise.Their service was amazing and the big burgers and crinkly fries were excellent.

But they are very expensive compared to other rooms. This vacation, we stayed in 1 cheap hotel (57) and 1 expensive hotel (168). Huge difference, and while the expensive one was far superior, I have to believe there was something good in the middle somewhere... The only major problem was the sink did not drain. They poured Drain-O down it immediately, so the fast response was appreciated, but it did not work. Everything we would have normally had to do in the sink, we had to do in the tub, like brushing our teeth, washing hands, etc. This isn't easy, especially with a toddler. The rooms were clean and nicely made up, and the beds were really comfortable. Unfortunately, we didn't get time to try out the pool, though I noticed after we left that it was saltwater, so my kids would have hated it. Breakfast is always good, and is free.

When he entered the original room the beds were not on their frames and it looked like the furniture was being moved around. His new room had no towels. The front desk informed us that they were out of towels. The pool water was a freezing but the room was 100 degrees. There were no towels at the pool either. We were told that hopefully there would be towels in the morning. The shower squealed when it was on and went from extremely hot to freezing. This was tons of fun with children who were trying to shower. The carpet in the hall and the main stair case was never vacuumed and disgusting. I know they never vacuumed it because we were there for 2 nights and it never got cleaned. As other reviews have stated breakfast was nothing to brag about. I would NEVER stay at this hotel again.

The room was large and comfortable but there were some areas where you can see the hotel is showing some wear and tear. Overall still very good. All the amenities of a Kimpton including 4pm Kids Hour, 5pm wine hour and most importantly for us Pet Friendly. The hotel was very busy as it was Memorial Day weekend so the restaurant and room service had delays but that's to be expected.

When I arrived, without warning, the bellhop led us to a standard double room (the cheapest type, with no balcony). I explained to him that we'd reserved a room w/ a balcony, he called the front desk and they told him none was available. He handed the phone to me & I asked the girl on the other end if I could speak to a manager. He was rude, did not apologize for the situation, & flatly told me that because I had booked through a certain third-party reservation site, there was nothing he could do about the error. He eventually clarified that since I had booked a room with one bed (albeit a King), but had asked for a second bed, they simply changed the reservation to a double room. He said there was no way to notify me of this, because the third-party reservation company does not supply the names or phone numbers of people who make reservations. He had no explanation for how the hotel front-desk staff had been able to match my name & ID to a reservation. Anyway, he refused to refund the difference in the price of the room. He offered to put us in a room with a balcony the next day. He told me to start calling them the next day at about noon to see if one would be available. One eventually did come available the next day at 5 p.m. & we took it. It was too dark to even see the balcony (half the point of a balcony room was to have the extra sunlight). I complained about it long enough that an hour later, someone showed up with a free bottle of wine & an apology letter for the \"miscommunication\", but there was never a refund of the difference in the price of the rooms, & the bad customer service made the trip a little worse than it needed to be.Our first room on the 6th (top) floor had too little water pressure to take a good shower. Other than that, the hotel itself was perfectly nice. Hopefully the manager moves on. I may try it again next time I'm in the area, but I would not recommend booking this hotel through a discount hotel website.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/694","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/670"},{"id":4776,"date":"2015-02-07T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"Nice hotel in a beautiful area of Washington.

We enjoyed our room decor quite a lot ! Parking was an unexpected difficulty, and frankly started our visit off in an unhappy way. We couldn't even pull up to the hotel in our car due to its position in the street. There is a tiny amount of space for cars to pull into the valet area in the front of the hotel. Once that area is filled with 2-3 cars, there is no where to even pull your vehicle to check in and unload the car. You end up in some garage down the street. Also, the front desk was not helpful when they kept repeating in half broken English, \"the valet will help you, the valet will take care of you\"-- yeah, maybe if WE COULD GET OUR CAR ANYWHERE NEAR THEM!However, once we finally got to out room, it was lovely. The rest of the staff was very courteous.

Old Town Alexandria is charming, and the hotel is right in the middle of it. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. The restaurant next to the hotel is a bit spendy, but pretty good. The room itself was a bit small, and I would have liked a lock on the bathroom door, but the beds and pillows were comfy, and the TV service adequate. Going into downtown D.C. was ~50 minutes door-to-door (to White House) by metro. I feel the hotel should offer a shuttle to the metro. We had to taxi, since the King street trolley only runs from 11AM - 7PM--walking to the metro, while doable at 20m, would have made for a tiring day touring D.C. The parking garage is old and space is tight, so a couple nights we had to pay to park elsewhere, but its workable. Most staff were nice, but a few times the staff were slightly less than helpful: room service comes too late in the day, and kept harassing us even though our child was napping and we asked them to come back later. One day while it was pouring rain outside, we tried to borrow an extra umbrella from the doorman (we're a family of 4 with 2 young kids), and were rebuffed [??]. But, the kids hour and wine hour are great, and the hotel is fun. Bottom line, the location is great, and the charm of the hotel and the surrounding area make some of the small inconveniences insignificant.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/582","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/54"},{"id":4821,"date":"2013-08-05T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here.

There's so much to see and do within walking distance. We valeted our car for $25 and walked everywhere. So overall it's a great place to stay. A few little critiques: 1. Some of the fixtures in our room we loose or broken. 2. The fridge is locked and you have to ask for the key. Kinda odd. It's stocked full of wine, beer and liquor, plus some snacks and even socks! BUT there's no room to put anything of your own in there ( I know, I know, it's wet bar, but one shelf would be great).

We stayed at the Klimpton Hotel (the location was perfect); however, the room we stayed in was extremely hot - the ac was barely working. On the bright side - the room was beautifully decorated.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/91","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/445"},{"id":4847,"date":"2014-03-25T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"We loved the hotel, and the neighborhood shopping and restaurants couldn't be beat!

We were very happy with this hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. They went out of their way to be friendly to Haley, especially the Doorman. She is 10 years old and loved it. The hotel was in beautiful condition. One exception, a small piece of marble was missing in one corner of the bathroom floor. Hardly noticeable but, I noticed. The pool was great and had a lifeguard, awfully nice when traveling with a child. I missed having a spa but the work-out room was nice. Doggy Happy Hour in the courtyard (yes lots of real dogs) was a hoot. I would definitely use this hotel again.

That is not this hotel. I booked because of experience with Kimpton hotels in other cities. This one does not meet the Kimpton standard. Examples: Showerhead that stays in one position (straight down because of faulty bracket), toilet that runs and hums long after the flush (don't think that's a feature), a totally dysfunctional internet, which they acknowledge was on the blink. Overall, the hotel just needs some management attention and it could easily be brought up to standard 4 star.

When I called for my car, I was told 5-10 minutes by the desk clerk. I went to the lobby in 10 and sat there for 20 more minutes. Not one staff member asked if they could help me or if I needed my car as I sat with my yellow ticket in hand. When I finally went to the desk to ask it was still a further 10 minutes before my car was brought up. I would have been happy to self park, if only I had been aware of the availability. You can exit the room and go straight to your car from the main elevators.The room was freezing, the unit made so much noise that it woke me up every time it cycled on and off. There were no extra blankets available in the room and so I spent my first night awake and freezing. I asked via a note the next day for housekeeping to leave an extra. The fried was also loud. I was next to the elevators which pinged all night. There���s no sound proofing and you can hear every conversation happening in the hallway.

We were happy to wait and could have lived without the unpleasantness. - Took 20 minutes and two phone calls to get our luggage up to the room after we were able to get in; on top of that they misplaced a very large pregnancy pillow that was placed in the office for safe-keeping. We finally had to walk down to find and retrieve it ourselves. - Found a black hair under the comforter upon arrival. - We were out of the room for at least 7 hours during the next day and no one cleaned our room. - The TV picture flickered on almost every channel. - We asked for a cart to bring our luggage down at checkout and no one came after 20 min. Finally had to go down to get one ourselves. Downstairs, an empty cart was sitting next to several bellhops who were chatting away to one another.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/399","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/869"},{"id":4903,"date":"2016-06-20T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"Wonderful location - however - many hotel guests with service animals - some of which were just simply large dogs.

The staff is ever present and helpful. The only downside to it was that the restaurant was short staffed one morning so we decided to go to another nearby spot for breakfast. We later learned from a bartender that one of the wait staff is pregnant and had been sick several times lately. And the bar closes early. There were quite a few people still in it when they made last call around 11 I believe. There is a wine happy hour every day from 5-6 in the lobby. One of the pourers actually remembered what I and my wife drank the night before. Finally, I had nearly forgotten this but the elevator doors close very quickly. We missed two because we were slow in getting there. Doesn't bother me, but I wonder if some seniors might find it difficult.

We were upgraded to a two floor suite with two separate thermostats, the bottom stayed cool, but the upstairs was still unbearable.

By the time we got everything unpacked and settled into the beautiful and well-appointed room, only a few items were still being delivered 24/7 by rooms service. The food and its service was my only disappointment.The brocolli cheese soap was cold when we got it, but the hummus was well-warmed to a degree that would have better suited the soup.My mother didn't received any napkins or utensils, so I shared my knife with her for the hummus/pitas.I ended up pulling out some travel napkins from my bag. I wish there had been a coffee maker in the room, but we ordered a carafe of it for breakfast.So those were the annoyances, but the room was so gorgeous felt roomy and was so well-appointed and comfortable.

DC has always been a difficult, if not frightening experience for me. Then along came Kimpton's Hotel Monaco Alexandria. Our room was a single king. It came with a large flat panel TV, pre-filled goody shelf and fridge, Free WiFi, nice lounge and plenty of room. The decorating was tasteful, well done, and quite comfortable. The most exceptional part of the hotel, however, was the staff. It was obvious that they had been well trained from house keeping to management. All were polite, helpful and made us feel welcome and at home. The location is incredible. It is located on King St about 4 blocks up from the river and one more block from the Ferry stop. King St is the main artery that runs through the heart of old town Alexandria. The setting is beautiful and relatively quiet. There are shops and restaurants up and down both sides of the street for blocks. History abounds here so there is plenty to do just in the local area without going into DC. If you want to do the DC thing, there is a free trolley which runs every 15 min from 10am to 10pm the length of King St (20 blocks) to drop you off at the Metro station. You can pick up the blue line there which will take you to about any site you want to see or get to including National Airport. Old Alexandria is a very comfortable place to be. I felt at ease walking along King St any time of the day or night.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/842","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/531"},{"id":4964,"date":"2014-09-24T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"Great place awesome view from terrace.

By 10 pm I had given up and tried to find another local room but none could be found for me. The manager assured me the wedding was over at 11, however that just happened to be when the die-hards moved the party to the courtyard; drunken guests whooping it up and taking flash photos. I had had a rough couple of days and just desperately wanted to go to sleep early that night; I finally passed out at 1 am. My night was comped when I spoke to the day manager in the morning, but the damage was done. The wedding party was obviously the priority to the night manager, who completely failed the rest of the guests in his charge.

Many other Alexandria hotels are by far superior!  This property is a former Holiday Inn and it still unfortunately felt like it.  I will stay at other hotels when I get back to Alexandria and will not consider this one.  This is so far below the standards of the DuPont Circle Palomar that I was shocked.  Unfortunately This will probably lead me to not consider other Kimpton hotels I have not seen before I stay at them.  The hotel was way way overpriced for what it is.  The chain needs to fix this one because it brings down the entire Kimpton reputation. They have a great King Street location but that is all.  The hotel did not even offer free newspapers--inexcusable for the price.  I left after one night and  spent the next four nights in a nearby hotel that was everything this one was not--and I paid $100 a night less.  This is a very poor excuse for a boutique hotel.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/673","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/544"},{"id":5034,"date":"2013-07-09T00:00:00Z","rating":2,"comment":"Set in beautiful Old Town, the setting for this hotel is quite calming and as a dog-friendly establishment, bringing fido was another plus... however, all the outdoor beauty and stylish hotel esthetics cannot mask how awful our customer service/staff experience was.

Without it's cover, of course, the sleeper is too cold to be comfortable.

However, it was a pleasant experience from the minute I stepped into the hotel. Staff (from the complimentary airport pick up/drop off, doorman, front desk, etc.) are friendly and professional. They also print out my departure boarding pass for the following day at no charge. (you can request a form to fill out at the front desk). The room decor has a unique historic setting yet modern color pattern which give a fresh and luxury look. It's also clean with big mirrors, sufficient lighting and space to feel relax and comfortable. One down side of the room is air conditioner is loud if it's on at night. One small part occur during my stay make this hotel stand out from the others. After the funeral I return to the hotel for a quick change, I was handed with a cool hand towel at the lobby. It was certainly a surprise yet appreciated during that hot afternoon. They also have ice tea available at the lobby and ice popsicle for the kids too. (during certain hour though).

The hotel is located right in the middle of Old Town and everything was within walking distance from the hotel. We were also traveling with 2 dogs and had no problems with them during our stay. My only complaint is the lack of grass for the babies to go do their \"business\" in around the hotel. We had to walk a couple blocks up to this one strip of grass for bathroom breaks. There are parks down by the water, but for late nite runs it would've been nice if we could have taken them to the courtyard for a quickie. Maybe they can invest in remodeling it in the future to accommodate their pet friendly status. Overall, it was an excellent stay with beautiful rooms and a very curtious and helpful staff.

There was also a fresh farmers market in the town square literally steps from the hotel. I really enjoyed all the fresh produce and baked goods for sale there. The only thing I was unhappy with at the hotel was the parking garage. It is so small and it was packed when we checked in. Once we finally found a spot we chose to not even drive our vehicle as to not have to encounter that stressful dilemma again! Another issue was that the room did not have a microwave. If one stays several nights and has left overs from a restaurant you can not re-heat anything in your room. Plus the room comes with a refrigerator but they pack it with their items they want you to purchase so that was also a hassle I just took theirs own and put mine in until I was about to leave and then restocked it with their items.

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels and had not-so-great experiences ... this one was a breath of fresh air.From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, everyone was always smiling, pleasant and very helpful. We were checked in very quickly and our room (two double beds) was big, very clean and smelled nice. The bathroom was so sparkling clean that my son (who is very picky) couldn't wait to take a bath (FYI, we are generally shower people.) Yes, the a/c unit can be loud, but when you're tired from a day of sightseeing and full from a big dinner ... all I can say is that I slept very well. I personally would have preferred a firmer mattress but that is really the only complaint I can make. When I realized that I had left my toothbrush and showercap at home, I called the front desk and housekeeping was at my door in 5 minutes with complimentary toiletries. As for Wi-Fi, just sign up on their website to join their club (no charge) and you will get your internet for free. I even read that you can get coupons for some free mini-bar use.My brother and his wife were on the trip with us and their room, with a king bed, was smaller than ours. Being from Europe, they are not fans of a/c to begin with and the loud noise theirs was making made it hard for them to sleep. They finally called guest services to complain because they couldn't turn if off either and were immediately moved to another room (just to sleep in) for the night. The next day while we were out, they had an engineer come in and fix the unit. By the time we came back, it was working fine and there was a bottle of wine waiting for them for their troubles.I did like the decor of the lobby ... colorful and eclectic but in a nice way. The location itself was great because it was so close to great shops and restaurants. There is a french cafe next door which was great for breakfast. We tried dinner at the restaurant downstairs ... although my dinner was good (bucket of fried chicken), my brother felt that the ribs and BBQ chicken were a bit dry. Overall, not worth the money we spent. The wait staff, however, was very efficient and friendly.The next night we tried an Italian restaurant up the street ... Bartucci's. This place was great! Their pastas were homemade and the seafood was fresh and cooked perfectly. Great wine selection also. This place was worth it and we will definitely go back next time we are in town.Overall, I found our stay very satisfying and reasonably priced. Checkout was quick and they even e-mailed me my bill. Based on my experience, I would definitely go back and I would recommend this place without hesitation!","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/368","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/379"},{"id":5184,"date":"2014-09-25T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"This hotel was in the heart of Old Town, making it a great location for visiting Alexandria, with just a stroll down to the waterfront.

Service was excellent, the appetizers were tasty and readily available.  The reception meal was very well done, food excellent and service very good.  A breakfast was held in the morning and it was a disaster.  The service was terrible, items ordered never delivered.  Waited an hour before getting two cups of tea, served piecemeal; first I got my pot, minutes later my wife got her pot, and 10 minutes later we got our tea bags.  We waited an hour between our order and the time it was served and my wife never got her toast for her eggs.  The manager came round and apologized for the poor service and said they were just overwhelmed.

My room looked out on a party that was happening in a courtyard outside my window and was very noisy late into the night. The bed was too soft for my liking. Asked for memory foam pillow and it really wasn't memory foam. And to top it all off I left a pair of sandals in the room and there was NO chance they were left anywhere else and they were never turned into housekeeping.

I believe it now. My room was tucked away in the farthest corner with a view of the dirty rooftop. There was a humming sound coming from outside that I didn't know would become irritating while sleeping. One set of friends had to move rooms because they didn't have hot water. The next morning they ordered breakfast through room service and gave up after 1 1/2 hours of no breakfast. I found out during the night that my room had no heat. When I first checked in, I just dropped my bags in the room and left to meet my group, so didn't notice that there was a problem. I returned late in the evening and it was cool in the room so adjusted the thermostat thinking it would heat up while I was sleeping. No such luck, at 3 am I woke up and it was 63 degrees in my room. Since I didn't want to deal with an engineer at that time of night, I bundled up, cranked the thermostat to 84 went back to bed. At 6:30, I gave up, showered and went down to the lobby where it was warm to await by friends. When I checked out, I told the clerk that they should check the heat since I had the thermostat cranked to 84 and it was still only 63 degrees. I was given a $7.50 breakfast for my trouble.Thank god I had a discounted rate, this hotel is expensive for what it is and what it offers.

She returned and asked me my name again and began the checkout process.  She offered no apology and failed to give me the correct pool hours, which I learned of after i visited the pool ready for a swim only to learn that it was closed for four hours midday.

This was our second time staying with the hotel and it was just as good as I remembered from two years ago. Unfortunately this stay much much shorter:(.We arrived just about when complementary wine hour began. Had just enough time to get to our room, freshen up and have a couple of glasses of vino. I enjoyed the merlot while my DH have the white (didn't notice what kind). The red was wonderful!Our room was nice and very clean. The only issue was the mini bar fridge wasn't working. After notifying the front desk, they sent someone right on it while we were out for dinner.Morning coffee is excellent, however I wish coffee was in the room for better convenience. Thank goodness I had someone willing to go downstairs and get some to bring back to the room.While staying, there were two weddings going on and lots of people dressed in suits and so on... I felt a little intimidated only because we weren't dressed to the nines. While sitting in wine hour, the lobby got very crowded and loud with the wedding parties but we were able to score a spot, find a place for dinner and do a little yuppie watching.All in all, this place is great!

The walls are paper thin and the guy in the next room kept me up all night snoring. The air-conditioning system is ancient and stopped working in the middle of the night. Before it stopped altogether the hotel engineer came in and said that it needed replacing. It took 2 calls to get room service to call me back after they said they would call in a minute (I waited 30 mins).

I went there for a romantic get away and ended up walking away feeling like i could have gone somewhere else and got a better deal, with better service, and had the services i paid for but never recieved (such as the pool and the big bathroom i saw online)available to me.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/563","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/682"},{"id":5378,"date":"2015-08-17T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"We've been to Alexandria many times but have never stayed at the Hotel Monaco until this stay but will make it our first hotel choice - what a wonderful hotel with a great staff","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/378","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/102"},{"id":5379,"date":"2012-10-30T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"Very simply put, PERFECT!","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/191","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/746"},{"id":5380,"date":"2013-01-07T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"super friendly and helpful staff! only complaint is about the wine reception. same wine each night, with one addition from time to time, and only snack was mixed nuts. also, was in the crowded, cold (December) lobby. would have been better held in one of the meeting rooms. if you don't care about a free glass of wine, this place is great!

We did experience the warm temperatures in the hallway but the lobby temperature was pleasent. On the 3rd night of our stay our AC broke in our room (and there was a loud party in the room next to ours). We called the front desk and they switched rooms for us pretty quickly. They even gave my son some toys to play with while we packed and did the swap. The location is amazing. Great restaurants around and plently of places to walk to. The hotel is not within comfortable walking distance to the metro but there is a free trolley that runs from the waterfront to the metro every 15 minutes.

Very easy to find. The room was spacious and well appointed. The wireless access was easy and very fast. My only complaints were the in-room iron was in very poor shape and the bathtub / shower tap had a continuous trickle of water unless you turned the knob slightly over toward the \"on\" position, which is obviously counter-intuitive. In the spirit of full disclosure, I did not bring this up with anyone until I was checking out. I was only staying for 2 nights and only needed the iron 1 of the mornings. My other negative was - while I was toweling off after my morning shower, I noticed a long strand of dark hair hanging off my shoulder. This was a bit gross as it clearly wasn't mine - I am pretty much bald with only a bit of \"peach-fuzz\" on the sides, which is mostly grey. It clearly must have come off the towel, which makes you wonder a bit about their laundry regime. Although, it could also have come off the cleaning staff when they were replacing the towels in the room. Either way a little \"icky\" from my perspective. However, when I brought the iron and bath tap issue up with the front desk attendant at check-out he was very apologetic and \"comped\" me a night of valet parking.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/721","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/246"},{"id":5393,"date":"2013-11-02T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"Our stay at this hotel was positive all round and if we visited DC in the future we'd be happy to return to the Hotel Monaco.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/61","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/657"},{"id":5394,"date":"2015-01-11T00:00:00Z","rating":3,"comment":"Usually I love Kimpton hotels, and even this one, but this time not so much.

Do not let the decor fool you. Our first room on the 4th floor was like having your bedroom set in a dog kennel, with dog owners leaving their pets unattended in their room while they were dinning and going out. Those poor dogs were barking to death and we asked to be moved. With our luck we were put next door to a room with about 10 people drinking and partying loudly until quite late which prompted us to move again. They put us on the 6th floor in a beat up room with its wallpaper coming off. It was not fully furnished compared to the other 2 rooms we saw previously. It had an ikea plastic chair and only one window the size of a basement window with a broken rolling shade (I wish I could attach the pictures I took). To top it off our room was right across the 3 elevators and their lovely bells that rang all night long. We could not sleep without earplugs. No boutique hotel would have rooms facing the elevators. There usually is a hallway design such as no bedroom door would be 10 feet away from the elevators. This is not a boutique hotel, not even close.

Our booking said we had free Wi-Fi but this turned out not to be the case. We soon realised what was being hidden - paw prints and dog hairs. I have never seen so many dogs in a hotel in my life (some really big ones too). We like dogs and are not afraid of them but didn`t like the idea of sharing a luxury? hotel room with one. It rained heavily when we were there and I am afraid there is no getting away from the smell of wet dog!

Eco-friendly policy? Our guess is the former.), but the temp was still comfortable, and it is not unheard of for hotel lobbies to be too cold. The in-room A/C unit was a bit noisy, but the kind you can easily tune out. The pool heat wasn't working, which is bad news for an indoor pool.

My only complaint was that the air conditioner in the room was loud when it kicked on, though very effective.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/986","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/575"},{"id":5490,"date":"2015-05-23T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"We came down to see a local concert for my friends birthday.

The front desk staff was outstanding. Doggie happy hour was great. The maid did not speak English so it was hard to communicate with her, yet she did an outstanding job. The men who opened doors and did the valet parking were obnoxious. They wanted a tip for just opening the door. If I tipped them for every time they got my car and opened a door I would have spent an extra $100. I bought some wine and one of the men kept bugging me to give him a bottle of wine. These men would stand around and talk in their native tongue which I think is rude. I speak their language and they were saying rude things about me and other guests. Unacceptable.

Due to the buildings architecture (very colonial, very appropriate for Old Town) the rooms on the 6th floor were very small and the ceilings were at an angle with a small dormer window.   I felt a little closed in.  They were very helpful and moved me to a room lower down with a little terrace that opened to the hotel's central courtyard.  Very Nice.

The location is wonderful. Right on King Street in Old Town Alexandria, and down close to the harbor. Very easy to walk for anything you need. Out for a snack or a meal, coffee or bagels, a walk down to the waterfront, a drugstore. And with the King Street Trolley you can easily get to the Metro. The room was spacious and very clean and comfortable and while youwere aware that is is an old building it was hid very well.The lobby and was open and welcoming but in the end the presentation and feel of the \"boutique hotel\" was not for us. There seemed to be a little something that rubbed me the wrong way about things. From the check in where we were told and extra $50 a night would be charged to our credit card for incidentals and would be refunded if we didn't use it. To the \"doormen\" that held open the door and kept talking to each other as you walked thru. Then there was the shuttle to the airport that didn't start to 7AM so was no use to us. The free wi-fi that you had to sign up as a loyalty member to use (on the longest form I have ever seen) To the dogs barking in the lobby. I like dogs but while a crying baby in a motel is horror story often told we all know the parents are doing what they can but a dog left barking in a room is just rude not cute at all.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/615","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/620"},{"id":5521,"date":"2013-04-20T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"Good hotel in Old Town.

My room was very comfortable and included many thoughtful details - plush bathrobe, yoga mat, minibar with a variety of snacks, lots of regular and USB outlets, free wifi. The hotel was in great shape, and I appreciated the free coffee service in the morning and wine happy hour in the afternoon. I was delighted to discover that the hotel has bikes that are free for guests' use - I wish I had been able to use them more than once! My room service breakfast was pricey but delicious and arrived exactly when ordered. And I was delighted to receive a surprise from the hotel one afternoon - a bottle of wine and a plate of snacks!

First of all, the hotel staff did not give out accurate information regarding parking and what fees would be charged. They told my husband one price and told me another. On top of that, they charged us for parking on an individual daily basis and a nightly basis so we got charged double. When I spoke with the front desk they said that it was 'just the way it works'. Absolutely horrible. The front desk assigned another couple to the room we were staying in so me and my husband were in bed when additional guests barged in our room, using keys that they got from the front desk! The room looks nothing like it does in the pictures. I understand marketing strategies but it was a far stretch from what they'd have you believe online. Do not stay here! The hotel staff are awful and inconsistent, the room is not the same as advertised, and you'll be charged an arm and a leg in additional fees.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/878","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/192"},{"id":5570,"date":"2017-03-17T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"Love the area!

Front desk had no record of the first call. By now the room temp was 82 degrees. The front desk assured us the problem would be dealt with. We left for the day and returned 7 pm. The a/c was STILL not repaired and the front desk had no progress report for us, no update, nothing. Our impression was that maybe they were hoping we wouldn't bring up the issue again. We asked for an immediate move to another room and were moved within 20 minutes.Second, smaller issue: we were in town to attend a funeral at Arlington Cemetery. The night before, my son needed his shoes shined. We called the front desk and were told to put the shoes outside our door, and they would be ready in the morning. Next morning: shoes had not been touched. When I complained to the front desk, I was told: \"Why didn't you bring them down to the desk?

Also, the pool is open odd hours - for example not before 10am on Saturday and Sunday and not between 10 and 2 weekdays, and they actually enforce this by not allowing the doors to open. The fitness equipment all worked, with the exception of the televisions attached to them. Also, TV advertised pay per view, but they must have changed it so it is not available.

I don't even know where to start. When we checked in, the conceriege asked if we were celebrating anything. When I told him it was our anniversary and my parent's 50th anniversary, he immediately went to get us somthing to drink and toast with. He was wonderful-the rooms were wonderful-the lobby was wonderful. Everything was wonderful. Well, almost everything. Our only problem was the air conditioner in my parent's room. When we notified the front desk, my parent's were moved to a new room immediately. I appreciated the speed at which the problem was addressed. The rooms were lovely, so large and roomy. The bathroom was spotless and equipped with great toiletries, hairdryer, and even q-tips and cotton balls! Really fun robes are in all the closets. Free wi-fi, huge flat-screen TV, in-room safe, and a beautiful chaise lounge chair. I loved this hotel. I've never stayed in a place where everyone was so incredibly friendly. The location was excellent-CVS pharmacy on the next block-a great restaurant next door-La Madeline. The King Street Trolley was convenient when we were on King Street but it was not very timely when we were needing it at the King Street Metro-it would finally show up but be prepared for a wait.

I think the only negative I could find is that the valet's weren't very attentive.

It needs some refurbishment and nowhere to shower before using it!The glass of wine available in the lobby for an hour each evening is a nice touch but the accompanying nibbles were poorThe staff are friendly and anxious to help but seemed to have limited knowledge of local facilities. An email enquiry prior to arrival went unanswered and I contacted hotel services 3 times during our stay about other things and on each occasion had to chase them up to get an answer.The hotel is situated at the river end of the long King St and is ideally placed for boat trips and the entertainment facilities.

The first night, we had problems with kids in the swimming pool after midnight making noise and running around. We tried to call downstairs but the room phone didn't work so we had to use our cell phone. After the call was made, the noise stopped after a while. The next morning, the toilet wouldn't flush. We advised the front desk and they fixed the toilet and looked at the room phone. When we mentioned all of this to the person checking us out, they comped us for one night of parking.

We found the service and management pretty bad.  The manager lied to us saying first they didn't even offer \"queen sized beds\" when we ended up with two doubles instead of the queen and then blamed it was our fault because we booked on Expedia.  We looked on their website and saw they did offer queen beds and have availability at the time and we then ended getting a room with a queen since \"they just has a cancellation\".  Then we ordered room service, waiting an hour, called back and our order was never even put in.  The girl we had ordered with \"left a long time ago\".  We did get a $25 credit to dine at Jackson 20, though.  Their food is good and it is a fun atmosphere.  Honestly, the Kimpton hotels are nice except for the service.  I believe they just have weak management.  We had a brunch for a baptism the same weekend at their other hotel (Morrison) and they were clearly understaffed and disorganized.  It was terribly slow and the manager of the food place only had one person taking care of 16 of us (this was a prearranged private booked brunch).  The food was good but it took 20 mins to get everyone their entree when it was a preset menu of choosing from two items  Definitely not the fault of the poor guy waiting on us but some problem with the kitchen or management.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/159","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/865"},{"id":5792,"date":"2015-03-06T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"Typical brick exterior in Old Town Alexandria, hides a warm inviting lobby with a fireplace, a deep turquoise blue and nicely appointed.  Friendly staff greeted me at the door, as well as at the front desk, where I was treated to drinks in the bar.  The d��cor is a bit busy, but fun.  My room was on a nice courtyard, which was closed for the winter.  I loved the d��cor, finish, appointment and comfort of the room.  Bed was super nice, bathroom, spacious and marble throughout.  Went to the bar for a night cap the first night, and a lively bar scene of patrons in their 30's to 60's, bartender made my custom drink, and I, being alone, enjoyed soaking in the atmosphere, trying to stay off my phone, except to check the hockey scores.

Because of its perfect location, style, nice staff and cleanliness. Cabs waiting in front of the hotel at all times. Walking distance to all shops and restaurants, the river and the boats.One thing that puzzles me in ALL hotels, not only this one is there will never be enough (sometimes even none) soaps, shampoo bottles and sometimes even towels for the number of guests the room is booked for-could it be because they want to save them, or because they want you to call and you have to tip the person that brings them?!Another thing-no morning newspaper on the date you are checking out.

My boyfriend and I stayed here for our two-year anniversary and I actually preferred the time we spent in Old Town close to our hotel, rather than the time we spent sightseeing. I can't say enough about what a great neighborhood the hotel is in. We stayed in a corner room with a king bed. The room felt much larger than your average hotel room and the decor is very unique. We valet parked our car in the underground garage for two days, which seemed easier than attempting to find parking in the busy neighborhood.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/379","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/693"},{"id":5798,"date":"2012-10-09T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"This hotel is located in the heart of Old Town Alexandria, a block west of the main square and about 4 blocks (maybe a 5 minute walk) from the marina.

The decorating is eclectic in a very modern way, but there is still an \"old world\" kind of feel.  The amenities were great (the shower was fantastic, love the hardware!), and the concierge helped us with everything.  It is the only hotel in Old Town with a doorman.  I would never have guessed, but there is a pool on the third floor.  The restaurant downstairs (Jackson 20) is very hip and swanky to go for a drink, and dinner there is very good as well.

A try of food from that 2 hour wait sat in the hall for 28 hours- along with other trays. Twice- service personal quietly locked on the door and then walked in before I could even ask who was there. On the third day, the room was cleaned but they did not actually close the door so my room and valuables were left exposed and vulnerable to theft- which is concerning when you realize that you can walk off the street into the underground garage and go into the elevator with no key and no one seeing you and straight to the hotel room floors.

However, this time around was not our usual pleasant experience. We had a unfortunate luck of being placed next door to a rude family with unruly children. The parents decided to take advantage of the wine reception, while leaving their two young children under the age of 10 alone to scream, bang on walls, slam doors and run up and down the hallways for hours. At one point one of the children rode the elevator down with my husband (a complete stranger) to find their mother. I will say the hotel staff did a great job locating their parents and handling the situation. Later in the evening, my husband was confronted by an intoxicated women wanting to join him in our hotel room. Needless to say, the wine reception was a spoil to our weekend.

We were there for a full weekend to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. The hotel staff made it very welcoming for us by providing champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries. We upgraded our room to one with a terrace, which was nice because it was a large room, and we got to see another wedding in the courtyard. The front door of the hotel is right on King Street, which was always busy with people walking around. The hotel is within walking distance of so many things. There are several cafes and small restaurants nearby. Parking is reasonable compared to other parking garages in and around the DC area.

I wish we had had more time to take advantage of all the hotel had to offer. It was an incredibly comfortable hotel room and the service was always friendly. My roommate needed a lint roller and she called guest services and while they didn't have a lint roller, they tried their best to solve her problem and brought her a roll of scotch tape. We had some drinks and appetizers at the hotel restaurant (jackson 20? jackson #), and the drinks were fun and delicious, as was the cheese and meat plate (I can't spell the fancy word for meat plate--charcuterie?). While it didn't wake me up or keep me up, once I was awake, I did notice that the sound from the hallway was very easy to hear through the door as we were right across from the elevator, but it was not an inconvenience to me, and the rest of our stay was very quiet and private.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/299","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/53"},{"id":5915,"date":"2012-08-07T00:00:00Z","rating":2,"comment":"We very much appreciated the welcome note and complimentary wine and treats in honor of our anniversary.

The building itself looks quite old, the elevator sounds and looks like it's about to fall apart. However the rooms inside are quite modern, neat, tidy. Basic but just what you need for an average priced stay near Lihue. Bed comfortable but some of the pillows had a slight dewy smell to them. Pool and jacuzzi nice. Restaurant small but good selection of meals and staff are very helpful in giving you suggestions of nearby eateries. One washing machine and dryer for the whole place was sometimes a nightmare (although it is free). Parking easy and free. WIFI signal too weak to be used on iPhones when we were in our room, weak signal can be picked up on a laptop. In the lobby the signal is strong and fast. The location of this hotel works well as you have easy access to the north and south. Overall a good comfortable stay, daily maid service was thorough.

The food at the restaurant was bad at best. Even after they bragged about just hiring a new Hilton chef, the breakfast was the same crap as before so I wasn't about to try dinner. The elevator is a tragedy in the making. The A/C in my room broke and fortunately they had another room for me. Two other families in our party had booked the bungalows on the property and on their second day they were told they had to move into the hotel as the parking area in front of the bungalows was going to be paved. Apparently the hotel knew this was scheduled yet they moved them in anyhow and made them spend nearly a whole day of valuable vacation time moving. I suggest you spend a few more dollars and book the Marriott beach resort on rice street in Lihue, that IS a resort and has fabulous restaurants close by.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/576","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/20"},{"id":6010,"date":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.

I noticed there was no water in the front lobby like most resorts have. No food available because it was off season (not even apples which most hotels offer as well). If we wanted anything to eat we would have had to drive into town. We had just driven 8 hours and it was snowing, so that wasn't something we wanted to do. Our room was very small with an option to be connected to the room next door if it was family. Since we didn't have family the door remained locked, but we could hear all the conversations, music and TV thru the door cracks. Coffee maker is stored under the sink in the bathroom. If you want to use it, you have to remove everything from the VERY SMALL counter space that is there. There is NO counter space in the room, only 4 drawers. View was nice from the windows, shower was nice. I requested a queen size bed, and got a double bed. My husband is 6'2 and his feet were hanging over the edge. Bed and mattress needed upgrading. Might be great for skiers who just want to ski and crash and not have any amenities or comfort. Even the main lodge had no where to sit and be comfy, as it was dark and had workmen in there cleaning.

If you wanted to watch TV you had to lay or seat on the bed. Using the coffee maker was impossible since on the sink was the only location adding risk if you were trying to get ready (teeth, etc) at the same time. There is a nook in the room which a shelf could easily be added for the coffee maker and ice bucket making room around the sink. In addition there is room for a chair in the room and would be easy to provide a lap desk (board to be placed on lap for laptop, etc). If you are going to use room as individual hotel room these should be a minimum since the main room is not available. I asked the front desk to have maintenance unlock the safe (locked shut by previous tenants) and they logged the request. Reminded them each morning and never done...on checkout the front desk did remove parking fees since this was not accomplished. In addition requested a temporary chair but never delivered.

Unfortunately we were a little bit late for the peak of that. The room we reserved was actually described on the web site as a tiny room -- surprisingly. Seemed to be a lock-off room that is part of a larger condo unit. It was by no means the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in but was rather poorly designed, especially in the bathroom closet area. Finding the promised coffee maker was a bit of a challenge -- it was hidden in the cabinet under the sink. Similarly the one waste basket was hidden in a back corner behind the toilet. The toilet and bath/shower were in a separate compartment with a ridiculous door that was just about impossible to close. I didn't try. The shower/bath combo had sliding glass doors that made it very awkward to use also -- a curtain would have been far better. Much of the closet space was totally inaccessible with a floor mounted safe facing sideways -- would have been a challenge to use. The toilet was extraordinarily low, as was the one easy chair in the room. It took a long time for the electric wall heater to warm the room and its contents to a comfortable temperature tho it was not that cold outside yet. Other than this, it was a nice enough room with a decent view. Not only was there a hefty fee for parking, it turned out that valet parking was mandatory and that parking seemed in very short supply. Excellent hamburgers in the restaurant.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/834","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/472"},{"id":6173,"date":"2010-12-03T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"The View (our restaurant) is the only place in Telluride that serves 1/2-yards of beer!","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/447","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/213"},{"id":6174,"date":"2016-07-21T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"Great location and you can have a full kitchen, fireplace and jets in your tub!

It has a log cabin feel with excellent lighting. The outdoor pool and hot tub are also a plus in addition to the lounges that surround the pool area. The hotel staff were extremely helpful with showing us how to use the gondolas and where the various hiking trail heads were located they even gave us an outstanding map. The main drawbacks of the hotel are the small size of the room and the lack of sound deadening between rooms. At check-in, the person tried to upgrade us to a larger room (for 60 more a night) however, since we were already paying over 200 a night, we declined to upgrade. Anyway, the room we were in was next to a utility room with a loud hot water heater that cycled on and off all night. Also, the walls were so thin that we could hear the conversations of the people next to us. To top it off, there were two rooms near us with barking dogs one two doors down and one right across the hall. We found out later that they put the people with pets on the first floor therefore, I suggest that you request a room off of the first floor if you don't want to hear pet noises. All-in-all the stay was fine but the amount of noise in the room was unacceptable.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/928","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/335"},{"id":6231,"date":"2016-03-14T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"Thanks Lisa for a great time at the View at mountain lodge!

We shared a double Queen room, and were happy it room was more spacious than we expected. Very comfortable and we didn't feel cramped at all. The amenities were comparable to what we'd expect from a nice hotel. And the breakfast was tasty and healthy enough to keep us going all morning long. The location was easy to walk to the French Quarter (we're good walkers), and we found some places to eat nearby when we were too tired to go farther away. My only complaint is that the guys handling our luggage storage were abysmally slow. We had to wait up to 15 minutes to have someone get our luggage out of storage.

The hotel was within walking distance to almost everything. With it being on the opposite side of Canal than Bourdon, there was no noise from people outside. The rooms were nice. Very comfy bed. The room had a microwave and mini frig, which was a nice surprise. Also, when we arrived at the hotel we noticed that the parking garage is right next to it. The website had said that parking was valet only and was 34, however the garage offered self parking for 25 per 24 hour period with add on hours if needed. The only thing is you don't have in and out privledges like with valet. If you plan on walking anyway or need to save a few bucks, that'd be the way to go. I would definitely recommend this hotel. The only reason for the 3 rating on the staff was due to the valets and bell boys congregating in the door way hollering with their friends. It was loud and unprofessional.

Spent one night there on 1/11/2016. When we checked in, the desk clerk gave us out two room keys cards and told me, in a threatening manner, that if I did not return both key cards upon checkout, I would be charged 3.00. When we arrived at our floor, there was room furniture stacked along the walls of the hallway on both sides. I plan to notify the building inspector about this because I believe it violates fire and safety codes. The phone in the room made buzzing and vibration sounds all night. I finally had to disconnect the phone. Went to take a shower and there was no hot water. When I went to check on my car in the morning, it was parked in by an 18 wheeler. I went to the desk, but they were no help. It took me about 45 minutes to find the driver to ask him to move the truck. He told me that the hotel staff allowed him to park there because he was delivering furniture to the hotel. When were checking out at 10:30 AM, we waited about 15 minutes for the elevator. The delay was due to the hotel staff using the elevator to move new furniture to the upper floors. This would have been OK between 11:30 AM and 3:00PM (after checkout time and before check in time). But the staff in this hotel allowed the move to take place during prime checkout time. I NEVER HAD A SINGLE APOLOGY FROM THE HOTEL STAFF. MOSTLY BLANK STARES. I will never, ever stay at this place again.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/164","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/680"},{"id":6412,"date":"2015-12-06T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"Clean great location staff friendly my fourth time here loved","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/719","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/372"},{"id":6413,"date":"2016-01-19T00:00:00Z","rating":2,"comment":"Heat in room did not work, hotel was under renovation (for good reason), phone had short in handheld connection, wi-fi very poor.

And no dining or bar facility on site. But the hotel is up-front about all that, so no real penalty. Also, the hallway carpet was missing because it is being replaced, but hey, at least that means that they refresh the facilities every so often. Most importantly, though, the room itself was clean and quiet. And there is free breakfast.

Breakfast was great. you can make regular waffles or blueberry waffles. eggs, sausage, fruits, danishes, muffins, toasts, yogurts. coffee, apple juice, orange juice. all you can eat. The only thing the hotel should invest in is a shuttle or someway to help get the out of town people can get to and from the beach. Also maybe upgrade the cable. Some movie channels and a guide of somesort would be nice. since it is so HOT it would be nice to stay in some a/c and watch a good movie. We were down for a wedding and did not have a car. I had read on other reviews that you can walk places and there are things to do. That is not even true. You can not walk to anything quickly. And you don't want to because it is so hot that it is miserable to walk anywhere. You need a car. Also on the way to your hotel stop and get water. The water all over Bonita Springs is awful.

The next night I came back, it was open but the hot tub was about the same temperature as the room, about the same temp as their pool, and had a better effect standing in a warm shower there. The 2nd visit I had was less than a week later and the hot tub was closed again. In their pool area there was no towels either and they don't give you very many towels to use in your room either.

I didn't know what it was at first, so I asked the guy at the front desk to come check it out. He was very helpful and nice. All the staff were very friendly. However, I will probably not be staying at another AmericInn and cannot recommend it due to the 100 dollar authorization hold that took about a week to come off of my bank account. I've never had a hold for that long while staying at a hotel. All in all it was a minor inconvenience and did not break the bank for me, but I don't think a hold needs to last that long. I called AmericInn about it, and the lady on the phone told me that it depends on however you paid and that it can take 3-10 days for the hold to come off.

We left with a smile on our face :)","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/653","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/949"},{"id":6688,"date":"2015-06-05T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"Our stay was wonderful.

The first time we flushed the toilet it overflowed onto our bathroom floor. When I called to have maintenance come up (at approx 9:30pm) to unclog the toilet, I was told that there was no one there to do that for me and that I could come down to the front desk and get the plunger to handle myself. I was told most guests prefer to do this themselves because they do not want strangers in their room. Really I'm on vacation - clearly that wasn't something that was on my must do list. I asked about changing rooms and was told they were sold out. I'm not sure that was truthful since the parking lot was clearly not full. With 3 children and it being 10pm at this point, finding a new hotel wasn't really an option. After being handed a plunger and extra towels I unclogged my own toilet and then proceeded to act as Certfied Plumber two more times that night and the next morning. Breakfast the next morning was the one positive of this stay. I never spoke to the manager - when I went to the desk in the morning to voice my concerns I was told she was on a conference call. The front desk clerk informed us that our bill would be reduced 20. She apologized and said because they aren't a 5 star hotel they do not have 24 hour maintenance. Would not stay here again.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/114","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/856"},{"id":6708,"date":"2015-08-31T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"50 dollar fee that is charged without notice but then returned.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/163","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/967"},{"id":6709,"date":"2016-07-09T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"I was disappointed that I requested adjoining rooms and got rooms across the hall from each other.

The grounds and rooms were kept up by great staff. Josh and other desk agents were beyond helpful but once again owners/management let them down (for example, I needed to print boarding passes, something needed by every traveler. They had a business center but guests can not print there. Why that is in 2016 is beyond me. So Josh offered to print for me, then asked if I wanted a second copy (because you never know, great thought - I didn't even think to ask, but he did)). So now he has to take care of my printing while running the front desk and he and everyone there did it with a smile. All the owners needed to do was buy and hook up a printer, such a small thing but makes all the difference. Staff gave great recommendations on where to eat and find things, again with a smile and not rushed. 5 star customer service on a 3 star property. Pay someone to really clean the pool and hot tub!

Building was secure with key cards at all entries. Hotel room was clean. Families stayed there and it was pretty quiet. It is no frills so don't expect the fancy toilet paper and pancakes for breakfast ( unless you make them), but you can save money for your family by cooking pizza in the stove or pasta on the range, use the microwave, fridge ( w/Ice tray) and the dishwasher.

There is no real drop off location for taxis, and if someone is picking you up you need to make sure you clarify which of the three mall entrances they will come to ... or walk across the street and meet at the hotel next door.

Wow - large dining table, modern living room furnishings, sliding split door into bedroom is what I expect from larger and more expensive hotels. All the modern amenities you would expect of a 5-star hotel are at this hotel. The 4th floor offers courtesy water and coffee every morning. Room service is also excellent, and prices are quite reasonable in light of the current money exchange rates between pesos and dollars. Housekeeping is quick with delivery for more towels, and hair dryer as requested in our last trip to this hotel. Hotel is located 2 floors above the Parque Alameda Shopping mall with several quick service restaurants you would expect in the U.S., a bank, bookstore, coffee shop, sporting goods store. You could stay in the hotel and visit the shops and spend your weekend there and not be bored, but you would then miss the sights and sounds of Mexico City. Definitely will return soon.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/590","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/998"},{"id":7050,"date":"2016-07-10T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"Muy bien atendidos","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/868","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/40"},{"id":7051,"date":"2014-04-24T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"Three Metro stops nearby and Juarez Park in front.

For me personally the only better located hotel would be the Melia, which I have yet to stay in, but depends on where your meetings are obviously. Traffic-wise, there are worse places in Jakarta to stay, which is a huge consideration. For instance, could not pay me to stay in Shangri-La again just due to the insanity of trying to get into or out of the hotel, and 24/7 traffic jam on the street in front. HIghly recommend this one.

Our room was one of the cheaper basic rooms by Mandarin standard however it could be compared to other hotels absolute best offerings! Calling room service always had a personalised greeting (caller ID), inroom dining was fantastic for a late night feast with some fresh salad and berries, rooms are kept immaculately clean and you always have plenty of towels and extras. Dining at breakfast time was superb as well, we showed up 20 minutes before end of breakfast and they still accommodated us wonderfully in a stunning restaurant by the garden offering traditional indonesian, japanese and international cuisine all for the buffet price. Think - smoked salmon, crisp pastries, espresso machine coffee made just for you, and even fresh sushi and sashimi made to order. Checking out time was flexible and arranged perfectly so that we could leave our bags for an hour at the hotel which we did not expect after previous experiences.

I asked ot have a room on the main floor and was told that there was a large group that didn't check out so I had to have a room on the second floor. I asked about an elevator which they claim there were none, a more appropriate response would be none for the public - because I saw a wheeled caddy and assume there is a way to get that up to the second floor. Regardless, I was told that the only room they had was on the second floor. I would have assumed too that when the desk crew (3 standing there) that one would offer to help with my things knowing that I was only going to be able to make one trip up the stairs. I glanced over, out of breath and struggling, are you sure there is nothing on the first floor The older male, shook his head no.

The sign posted behind the front desk stated that check in was at 2pm, check out at 11am. I checked into my room shortly after 5:30pm was told at the front desk that I could not go to my room yet. The hotel had decided to RECARPET the rooms Memorial Day weekend the hotel was completely booked so I could not change rooms. I was tired after my drive wanted to change my clothes before going out to a family dinner could not get into my room. When I got back to my room later that even the carpet was like something out of a fun house. I was grateful that it didn't smell heavily of fumes that my room was clean, housekeeping did not leave a new roll of toilet paper the person at the front desk was not able to leave so I had to go to the front desk. The room was comfortable which was nice I was up early the next morning to get ready. The carpet company was back before 9am to continue remodeling the rooms. While they rearranged the furniture in the halls they kept knocking things against my door the obstacles in the walkway made it very difficult for me to navigate my way to the door while I loaded my car before check out. Very disappointed that I could not get to my room could not believe that they had chosen that weekend to remodel the hotel. I could have stayed else where for less not have been so inconvenienced.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/532","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/240"},{"id":7244,"date":"2014-11-22T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"The neighbors were too noisy but everything else was great","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/43","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/12"},{"id":7245,"date":"2014-09-19T00:00:00Z","rating":3,"comment":"Other than the spider crawing up my leg in the bathroom, it was okay.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/92","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/102"},{"id":7246,"date":"2015-10-23T00:00:00Z","rating":1,"comment":"The room was very dusty.

Regarding to the 1st stay (one year ago) the situation changed in the worse direction: Even I'm a re-booker and I booked early with the wish to have the room in the direction to the quiet garden side (like last year) the hotel put me to the street side which is horrible loud even in the night which makes it impossible to sleep with open windows. The breakfast is very poor in the scope and in quality. One day old and hard bread, another day the broken coffee machine. Lot of times empty plates in the buffet have been refilled not till we asked to do so. But the worse is that now there are cats allways in the breakfast room. I really like cats and they are sweet but when guests first touch them and later e.g. the bread of the buffet that is far away from simple hygienic roules. Other guests (e.g. with allergy) will be amused very much.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/184","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/45"},{"id":7391,"date":"2013-10-12T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"A pleasant surprise.

The room door opens to the outside, and there's about a 2-3 minute walk through the parking lot (no paved footpath) to go to the office or the pool from the room. The staff wasn't that friendly I'd guess they get customers trying to push the rules frequently. They wear ribbons and get stars if customers write a good review, but the scheme seems a bit forced.

The main reasons why I gave only 2 stars are: My first impression was that the hotel is not well lit. I arrived at night and was uneasy. My room smelled bad. The odor was like a wet dog or urine. (probably because it is pet friendly and not cleaned well). The room was old. The carpet was very worn and did not look clean. When I stay at a hotel I pull back the sheets and mattress pad to look for bedbugs, lice, fleas, etc. There was no mattress cover, seems unsanitary (good news - no bugs) The bathroom towels were unacceptable. My bath towel had a large brown stain. Gross! The face cloth was hard and stiff. Lastly regarding the towels,there were only one of each kind. I found that to be strange and inconvienant . I did not have another bath towel besides the stain one. The bathroom ceiling was low and the fan was noticeably visible. It was dirty. I actually touched it and it was so dirty that it felt sticky. The continental breakfast was low standard. Powdered creamer, no half and half. Bagels in cellophone bags. I swear the orange juice was Tank. I expected real juice in Florida. I want to end on positive points. The Wi-Fi worked well. My alarm clock was busted but I did receive a wake up call. The location of the hotel is convenient. It is right on the main drag of hwy 19. By the way, I did write a note to the housekeeper so she could have an opportunity to improve the cleanliness.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/779","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/359"},{"id":7459,"date":"2016-06-18T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"It was such a wonderful stay for my boyfriend and I.

The best thing about this hotel is the private balcony, I paid more to over look the cannas and I'm glad I did because that was the only place I couldn't hear the highway traffic. The traffic wind was so bad that at night it sounded like someone was trying to get into the room. The door actually shook! The room itself was large and decorated shabby sheik, I could tell the furniture was newer but it had the old look about it. What bothered me most was the smell, it was a musty, mold smell and the sheets were the same way. The were so bad it was hard to sleep. I had to go get blankets to use from home, so that defeated the me time I needed. The bath room was nice, minus the very low toilet. The in room coffee pot is a joke and I had to buy one to have a real cup of coffee. Also trying to get ahold of the staff was crazy! The phone rang and rang before anyone picked up and everyone minus the young man who checked me in were rude and unfriendly. The house keeping staff saw I was trying to get on the elevator with the lugage cart and went up alone instead of letting me on. That was the only elevator that worked near me, the other was broken, and this one sounded like it was about to break as well. The whole place smelt bad and musty!

The Innisbrook resort didn't have a room for the first couple of nights so I stayed at this hotel. It looked okay from the outside, but it smelled very musty and old despite apparent attempts to keep it somewhat updated. My room, though kept clean, smelled musty and there was no weather stripping around the entryway door so lizards kept getting into my room (probably chasing the bugs that also got in). It had a balcony, but this is Floridatoo humid to be outside if you don't have to be. The fitness room was very small and had only a couple of pieces of the Quitman that were seriously updated. The continental breakfast was average or slightly below compared to what you get everywhere else. The bed, surprisingly, was very comfortable. The pillows were not the best I've ever had, but they weren't the worst either. The room furniture was extremely cheap two of the dresser drawers didn't even open, and the computer table was so shaky that I was almost afraid to put my laptop on it. This is just an awful hotel, but it is somewhat budget friendly.

Fantastic views from the balcony! The staff were really helpful in recommending places to visit and things to do.The road was close but caused us no disturbance. The staff were also helpfull and friendly. The only thing that let our stay down was the meal we had at the hotel on our first night and we didn't have dinner there again. The meal was very over priced and unfortunately the most expensive but worst meal of our holiday. My husband ordered lobster which hadn't been cleaned properly and I was disappointed with my order. There were plenty of other places to eat in town which was only a 10 minute walk and we found the food much better in the restaurants there. The nearest beach was clean, quiet (at the end of July) and beautiful although if you hire a car there are plenty of other similar beaches within a reasonable distance. Recommend car hire to see more of the island but although the roads are in good condition be prepared for sharp corners on fast mountainous roads with sheer drops. If that doesn't put you off exploring by car is probably the best way to see this beautiful island with its stunning beaches","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/591","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/648"},{"id":7498,"date":"2014-08-27T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"Hotel a taille humaine, tout le monde etait au petit soin, nous y etions avec un enfant en bas age en compagnie d'un couple d'ami avec un bb le service est impeccable surtout les serveuses du resto toujours souriante et prete a rendre service","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/518","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/993"},{"id":7499,"date":"2016-06-22T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"Loved the hotel and staff.

We asked the staff on three occasions to fix it (and showed them on our device that we don't make it up because they claimed it worked). When we left they claimed that an IT guy fixed it but they never asked us before whether it worked for us. The least we would expect in a FIVE star hotel. - we had to pay about 100 USD for roaming fees instead (as we had to work). We were not offered a discount or anything. - Breakfast EUR 30 per person, some cutlery not clean - Shower head broken (but fixed on the next they when we told it to the staff) - Gym oldish, one thread mill not working. Spider webs in corners - Hotel is located above a busy street (separating hotel from beach). In our room with sea view, we couldn't leave the windows open and balcony was just for decoration but not really for use The above critics sounds harsh, but we expected definitely more of an expensive five star hotel.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/694","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/798"},{"id":7516,"date":"2015-08-28T00:00:00Z","rating":2,"comment":"chambre et batiment non en adequation avec un etablissement cense etre un 5 etoiles.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/207","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/877"},{"id":7517,"date":"2015-08-25T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"Un hotel con todo lo necesario para descansar cerca de la playa con comida exquisita, atencin buensima y la cama de lujo!","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/215","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/817"},{"id":7518,"date":"2016-07-31T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"This is really a nice hotel in a beautiful setting.

They ran out of several items at the overpriced breakfast (EUR 30/person) before closing. Housekeeping was ok, but several small mistakes that you wouldn't expect from a 5* hotel. Reception staff was friendly. Nice, but small pool. Charged EUR 10 for a beach towel plus umbrella. Fantastic beaches within 30 mins drive. Beautiful views from the terrace.

There should be a back or side entrance for deliveries, not in the front directly under the windows of the patrons paying a lot of money for the stay.

The hotel is very nice, right there in French Quarter, but not at the noisy main street. Only 3 blocks to walk and you are in the middle of it all! Breakfast was very nice too! Hotel has charming feeling, and staff was vey friendly. The only issue I had, was the fan/AC noise, from unit of the room. As I was sleeping right next to it, and I am also a very light sleeper...turned it off one night, and then no problems to sleep. Also noticed the street noise, like garbage truck, can be a nuisance if your room is on the street side like ours.

The location is right across the street from a mall and very close to the downtown area, and there is a Denny's right next door if you don't want to have to go far to eat. The complimentary breakfast is somewhat limited. Only some minor quibbles about our room: 1) it was difficult to get the air conditioning to a comfortable temperature -- it was rather cold, 2) the room was crowded with things that had obviously not originally been designed to be a part of the room (it's an older building), like a refrigerator and microwave, so most of the available outlets were taken, and the one or two that were available didn't work, which we reported to the staff. We just unplugged the alarm clock and used that outlet, 3) the room was a bit crowded with furniture, making it difficult to use the table in the corner. Other than that, it was fine. I would stay there again, especially considering how much lower the price was than other hotels, and I especially liked that the low price was available with free cancellation.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/174","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/623"},{"id":7870,"date":"2016-07-08T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"Customer service was excellent","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/891","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/725"},{"id":7871,"date":"2015-08-15T00:00:00Z","rating":2,"comment":"As the saying goes, you get what you pay for.

They tried to charge us for an extra room. 3 different times the key card on our door would not work taking nearly 30 minutes each time to get into our room. They gave keys to our room to people not authorized to be in their. Cops were banging on our door at midnight, threatening to kick us out because the hotel mess up on the room number that had a noise complaint.

We could also hear the elevator door dinging. With the air on the noises were muffled enough to not be problematic. Still, expect more from a Hilton. The rates were reasonable, the staff excellent, and if not for the noise the room would have been excellent as well. We did have housekeeping attempt to just freshen up our bed linen rather than change them. I am not sure if they are trying to conserve water or something, but we asked that they be fully changed and housekeeping quickly complied.

It's not the fanciest hotel but the staff was friendly and the room we stayed in had everything we needed: a comfortable bed, a shower with working hot water (though the pressure wasn't the best), free wifi, and a Keurig to make coffee. Each day in the lobby they also provide guests with infused water and unlimited coffee. We were planning on eating breakfast in the hotel one morning, but with so many great brunch places in the area we ended up eating out each day. One thing that visitors should be aware of is that they place a 50 hold on your card for incidentals. I was a little worried this would be an issue, but about a week after our trip, the hold was removed and no additional charges were added on my account. The hotel itself is a bit hard to find at first because it is hidden behind a Bone Daddy's restaurant on the front and the back of the hotel faces a residential area which made it hard for Google Maps to give us good directions. Despite the trouble finding it when we first got there, we enjoyed our stay enough that the Hilton Garden Inn is our new place to stay when we visit Austin.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/781","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/900"},{"id":8099,"date":"2016-06-24T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"Great place to stay if you're planning on venturing out and seeing more of Austin.

Well, when people ask how my trip to Portland was I must reply it was great once we got to the right hotel. Several years ago we took advantage of a big deal package at the Governors Hotel, it was very pleasant, a nice room with a fireplace, the steam room and pool. So I planned, a couple of months ahead, a get away for my husbands birthday. When I first looked at the big deal, I did not see any rooms available, so I went to the Governors Hotel website and made reservations for the Winter Warmer. A couple of weeks later, I got an email s that talked about Portlands Big Deal, so I checked The Governors Hotel, and they were now available- having such a nice time last time, I called and asked if they were the same deal, but the big deal being just bit less expensive- Oh, yes, they are the same. I commented that I wanted a fireplace room like last time- oh yes that should not be a problem. So I cancelled my winter warmer reservation and made a reservation on the big deal and made a note in the note box- fireplace. When we arrived our room was on the 2nd floor and about the size of a closet. The hallway was full of restaurant noise, and the view as the desk person called it was of a very dirty and ugly center courtyard. We went down to the desk and complained and told of our last experience and expectations. The gal at the desk told us that rooms were assigned that morning- I do find it interesting that people making reservations over a month in advance get the smallest, noisiest room- I guess it does not pay to plan ahead. So I called another hotel that came to our rescue and treated us with the greatest of care. I now paid for parking, and paid for a more for a room- both items that I had not planned on- I would have taken the train rather than pay for downtown parking.

The SceneThe Governor was built in 1909, following the prosperous days of the Lewis and Clark expedition. The initial idea was to bring a hotel of quiet elegance to downtown Portland. Back then, guests only paid 1.50 to 2 for a room--and that included breakfast. The prices have changed, but the hotel is still elegant. The interior is filled with warm-hued early 1900s-style furniture, a Lewis and Clark mural, and mahogany-trimmed walls.The DetailsThe multi-room suites have terraces, jetted tubs and fireplaces. Guest rooms feature large, comfortable beds, fireplaces and a warm ambience. For business travelers, the Governor provides an executive business center and meeting facilities modeled after rooms in Italian palaces. The hotel also houses Jake's Grill, one of Portland's most popular restaurants.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/967","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/728"},{"id":8145,"date":"2005-07-14T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"I was the maid of honor in a wedding and I needed to get into the room early, to do all of the usual preparations.

Our room was outfitted with a microwave, mini fridge and cable tv. The hotel front desk attendant was friendly as was the house keeper. While not directly on the beach, its a relatively short trip to the beach/casinos. The NJ transit system has buses that pass through the area hourly, if you dont happen to drive. Cons:While there is a beverage vending machine and ice machine on site, you would have to go elsewhere for food. Denny's is about a 5min walk from the hotel and you could always order in.

It is a fairly basic hotel, but the owners appear to put extra effort into keeping it very well-maintained and very clean.

The room is extremely outdated with items broken, stains in the carpet, and the room is extremely musky and dusty. The manager called me up halfway through my stay and said I had to change rooms because he booked my room for someone else, so I had to pack up and move to another room and if I wanted to stay in that room, i'd have to pay. From the moment I arrived to the moment I checked out (I left a few days early), I was given poor service from the manager. There are tons of hotels/motels around where this place is, so look for somewhere else before you give this manager any additional income. When I went to check out early because I couldn't do another night of poor customer service, There were 3 other parties of customers who were complaining as well. The office isn't open 24 hours, in fact its open when the manager wants to be in the office and he'll ''cut you a deal'' if you can provide him anything in return.

However, the proper is more like rectangle shape so depending on where your room is located and if you are parking near it with limited parking space outside or at the big parking lot.

It was severely understaffed for a busy weekend and the staff (except for one lovely woman, who also began to show the strain toward the end) was very unfriendly and not at all helpful. They were clearly overwhelmed. Not enough towels or pillows given this time for a room that obviously sleeps more than two - and no more at the desk. Not enough food to go around for the free breakfast - coffee was beyond terrible. The room felt very very damp the whole time. All in all - it appears Hyatt is cutting corners at this hotel and they will lose business. Not a smart choice bc great location and usually busy.

We like the layout of the hotel rooms. We have never had any issues with our stays. This was the first time we had a few issues arise. When we arrived check in was quick and easy front desk staff was very friendly. Our room was a handicapped room, which was not an issue for us. The room was missing some essential items. There was no toilet paper so I had to go down to get some and there was no spare blanket in the closet for the sofa bed. So I had to make another trip to get items that are almost always in the rooms already. The next night I needed to get some ice but I needed another ice bag so I went down stairs to ask for another bag and the front desk staff filled it up for me right there so I didn't have to make an extra trip to the ice machine. The staff was happy to help out with no issues. Overall it was a great stay just a few minor issues. I will stay at Hyatt Place again in the future.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/800","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/487"},{"id":8395,"date":"2011-10-31T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"music can be a bit loud, and can be heard in the adjacent guest room. so exercise quietly! :-)","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/110","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/329"},{"id":8396,"date":"2015-12-17T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"Great room, great staff, late check out-no problem.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/492","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/93"},{"id":8397,"date":"2015-12-04T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"Very convenient location close to airport and quarry market","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/943","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/670"},{"id":8398,"date":"2016-07-21T00:00:00Z","rating":2,"comment":"AWFUL!!!!

My 3 night reservation specified a late check in a king room in a quiet area. I was given a room directly across from the elevator,that smelled of urine - unacceptable. There were no other king rooms so I moved to a double was told that I could move to a new king room the next day when several guests checked out. Not a problem. Day 2 - Next morning, I stopped by the desk to confirm the day staff knew of the proposed room change. I said I understood this couldn't occur until after rooms became available housekeeping was done cleaning rooms. The woman at the desk was snarky, said there were no king rooms available house keeping wasn't done. I pointed out that I understood was there to confirm the day staff understood the situation. She said she would make sure the change was taken care of. Later in the evening, I called the hotel to confirm my king room was secured was told my room was ready. When I returned to the hotel that night, I went to my new room found they had given me another double! When I finally did get my king room there was no soap but fortunately, I had packed my own. 3 nights, 4 different rooms! The only thing that made my latest stay at the hotel bearable is that with the exception of the one snarky lady - Delores- everyone else on the staff (front desk housekeeping) was genuine, friendly and made me feel welcome.

They were nice about it and offered a complementary dinner from their restaurant in the lobby. I was super irritated. When we got to the room the AC wasn't on very high and it was so stuffy in the room that the crisp white linens on the two double beds were actually soft and wet to the touch.

The full length mirror was cracked, the carpet was shredded in spots and appeared to have a cigarette burn (non smoking room supposedly), there were scratches in the furniture, the sofa was ripping. The bed was comfortable and clean at least. Down the hall was a pile of dirty dishes which sat outside a room during most or our two day stay.

Little did we know that a good night's rest would not be happening. As we opened the sofa bed we encountered a good amount of bugs crawling on the mattress. It was easy to see the bugs because of the white sheets. They were definately, without a doubt, bed bugs! Disgusting to say the least. That was where my twin 4yr old girls were going to sleep! Not a chance that was going to happen now! I went to the front desk and they told me the hotel was booked so nothing else was available. I didn't want to stay there period but my girls were so exhausted we all were! It was really late at night too.

We pulled into the hotel late Monday night after driving all day in a moving truck. I had originally parked on the side of he building but noticed tempered glass on the ground, which made me a bit concerned for safety. After talking to the front desk clerk, she acted surprised that I would ask about safety as we have never had vehicles broken into and blew off my comment about broken glass. She recommended I park in the back where it was well lit and next to the back entrance. We did back up the truck a few stalls from the entrance and under a light so I felt better about it. Next morning my drivers side window was smashed in and the ignition was busted up. I will leave out all the details, but I met the perpetrators because they were parked next to my truck trying to jump their car but left in another vehicle after I called the cops. Turns out their car was stolen. There were also others working on cars around my truck who left shortly after I called the cops.

Those who have looked at other hotels around San Antonio know all the extra expenses for parking, breakfast, crazy deposits, and what not. I had a specific list of things that were a must for staying in San Antonio. It had to have free parking, complimentary breakfast, decent pool, nice room. The pool could have been a little more extravagant but it was fine. Parking was easy. The breakfasts were nice with a nice selection of breakfast sandwiches, waffles or pancakes, cereal, pastry items donuts. Milk and Juice and fruit were available as well. I was pleased as well as my family. The staff was super nice and although I didn't order anything, they have a 24/7 kitchen to order food from. The room had plenty of space, A sofa area with a workstation area and another counter for what ever slightly separated from the bed area and bathroom. I thought being fairly close to the airport that we would hear planes but it wasn't the case. My only complaint at all about the place is that I wish the bathroom was a little more updated. Tub drained a little slow and the faucet dripped a bit but the bathroom was fully functional. The location was great. It is just off highway 281 and right across from the Quarry market which has a super nice movie theater, shops and tons of places to eat. One of the places there consists of a Joes Crab Shack which is a + for us. All in all, I think I found a place to stay when we come.

I am in a transition period in my life right now... I am in the process of moving and between where I used to live and where I am moving into, I needed a place to stay. Obviously money is an issue right now and there are the obvious costs with moving. I was and still am stressed out. On New Year's Eve, I was tired stressed, lonely, and frustrated. After bouncing around the whole city to find the right accomodation, I stumbled upon Discovery Inn. When it was my turn to get a room. I was blown away at how Kim, who was working the front desk was attentive and caring right off the bat. She noticed how tired I was and she first of all, made every effort to cheer me up and made me smile. She then reassured me about the amenities and about the hotel and how to best utilize everything. This was the beginning of a good, relaxing night. Even the occasional follow up was greatly appreciated. I have traveled all over this country on business and personal vacations. I have never received service where someone like Kim would take notice and reach out to make my day better and understand my needs and match the product accordingly. I am in sales and have been for a long time. Its always a good feeling when someone actually listens to you and understands your needs. This stay has been very enjoyable. I want to send a special shout out to Kim for her customer service. It goes a long way, and it has for me.

I could not sleep well. 4) On 3rd day, the faucet of the bath tub was broken. Since I stayed there for my business, I had to hurry up. I couldn't turn off the faucet for 2 hours. So, they gave me another room to use the restroom which is at the end of the building and my room was at the another end of the building. It took around to 5 minutes to walk for washing my hands. 5) There were dead cockroaches in the refrigerator and some parts(dial) was broken. It didn't work well, and I complained about that to the old man who I mentioned early. He said that the only thing he could do was that he could leave message for maintenance.

I stayed there for 4 days. On the first day, refrigerator was not working, but they did not repair it for 2 days even I informed it. Someone in the front desk did not leave the message for it. In the refrigerator, there were a couple of cockroaches. Also, there is some bad odor in the room. It is like human's odor. On the 3rd day, the faucet of bath tub was broken. I had to use another room which is really far from my room to use restroom. In the morning, there is some construction or garbage car. I had to wake up around 6 because of that noise. Also, there is no elevator. I had to move my infant son and stroller on my own to 2nd floor. They did not give me the room on 1st floor.

From the relatively tranquil settings of the hotel pools you can pop through an exclusive turnstile straight into Meditterania and enjoy all the fun of what has to be the best theme park outside of Florida. The hotel is immaculately kept with the quaint look of a Mediterranean village and offers acres of outdoor space to stretch out and soak up the sun although, like most hotels it fails to provide enough shade and parasols are scarce. The rooms have recently been renovated and there's free Wi-Fi in all areas (as at July 2014). In the neighbouring theme park there's an amazing variety of rides and shows to suit everyone. The main gripe is the lack of decent food in any of the restaurants. With the exception of Rac de Mar near the entrance we experienced cold, bland and overpriced dishes at all of the restaurants in addition to poor service. At The Iron Horse Hotel and the Steak House we could not distinguish between any of the meats served. Most of it tasted like I cooked it - which isn't great! For those staying at the hotel I would suggest you take advantage of the ample breakfast and eat out at nearby Salou for half the price and twice the choice. Its just a few minutes in a taxi to the main promenade.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/790","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/693"},{"id":8689,"date":"2015-08-29T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"Brilliant location for access to the theme park. Entry is into the Mediterranean area, which is where the parade and fireworks occur each evening. We upgraded to a superior room. Beds were really comfortable. Nice furnishings. Exceptionally clean. You get a few toiletries, but seeing as we were three people they only gave us 1 toothbrush! Luckily we took ours!. The Max pass only allows you access to the front of the queue for one time only on only one of the days of your holiday. We upgraded to Premium Express for an extra 39 euros each which entitled us to quick access to the major rides as many times as we liked for all days that we stayed. (We stayed for 7 nights so it was excellent value.) I would definitely recommend doing this, especially in the school holidays as some queues were 2 hours long! The Dine Around facility means that if you stay half board you can swap the evening meal from the hotel to one of the a la carte restaurants in the park..We loved the Iron Horse.

You could heat the room or turn the heating off but to cool the room down wehad to keep the window door open which was a security issue. The hotel is cheaply constructed and thus the walls are paper thin and the family next door was very noisy so this affected our sleep each night. The breakfast was very standard without any frills - e.g. no fresh juices just orange and pineapple made up from concentrate powder etc. The food on offer in the hotel restaurants in the evening was also very limited and unappetising. I would recommend staying elsewhere and just buying day passes for the theme park.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/629","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/383"},{"id":8698,"date":"2015-08-26T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"we were very disappointed with hotels.ie..what you offer us and we paid wasn't what we got in port aventura..we had a big discussion with the manager at the hotel...he told us that your offer what we paid they didn't have at the hotel...so you should check in your web what you are offering is what they have...very disappointed with hotels.com for the first time","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/563","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/166"},{"id":8699,"date":"2016-04-18T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"Les + accs au parc Chambre spacieuse Le cadre extrieur Les - Literie bcp trop ferme et edredon","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/257","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/734"},{"id":8700,"date":"2015-09-26T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"Great for park access, nice area to queue whilst waiting for the park to open, in keeping with the general park motif - lots of pretty flowers in pots. Almost no waiting, we got straight in in September for access to the Hallowe'en Themed Park. Fairly reasonable prices for food. I believe El Paso is the only All Inclusive hotel. We stayed BB in Hotel Poraventura and had the buffet meal one day. A wide variety of food for the buffet, with a nice choice of soups, pastas, cheeses, fruits and assorted desserts. 62 with a bottle of wine - slightly higher than we had paid in Salou. BB is typical fare: hot food of 3 types of sausages, bacon, eggs, tortilla espaol, beans also available are churros, waffles, pan au chocolate cold meats such as salamis and ham fruits, such as sliced melon, watermelon, orange, peach whole fruits yoghurts. Coffee and fruit juice machines available (although it was rare to see all of these working simultaneously)! Quite a walk from Salou centre. Complimentary car transfer to the Portaventura Station on leaving, which was nice. Although no kids in our party, it was appreciated that Woody and the Kids Club entertainers kept them happy!","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/22","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/927"},{"id":8701,"date":"2014-05-22T00:00:00Z","rating":3,"comment":"This hotel offers direct access to Port Aventura, two pools and a number of restaurants. What we liked about the hotel are helpful staff, access to Port Aventura and the proximity to Salou and Salou beaches (20-30 minute pleasant walk). What we didn't like are the quality of the rooms and the food. We asked for a transfer from the first room due to mold in the bath tub area and the new room was better but still not the standard we expected. The breakfast buffet was also disappointing. For example: scrambled eggs were done poorly, juices (orange/pineapple) were diluted, croissants were not good and very limited cheese selection. The other restaurants for dinner were better but nothing special. Before coming to PortAventura Hotel, we were at another 4-star hotel in Barcelona and so we easily noticed the difference in room quality, services and food quality. We would consider another hotel if visiting Salou or Port Aventura again.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/235","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/523"},{"id":8702,"date":"2015-08-19T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"Genial, buen hotel,buen ambiente, repetiremos","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/122","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/3"},{"id":8703,"date":"2015-08-20T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"Only had to wait 15 minutes to check in after arriving at 2am.

Huge but still managed to seem quiet. Staff were nice but guest services in particular weren't particularly useful. Knew lots bout the theme park itself but nothing else of any use. We asked how to get to the local town and were greeted by shrugs and general confusion - it's about a 20 min walk - but couldnt give us directions!Turns out there was a bus stop at the entrance and it only took us 10 mins to walk anyway. Good hotel for families though. Clean, quiet, fabulous pool. Very expensive to eat or drink though so either go half board or be prepared to go into Salou every evening. Pool is huge, but there are only enough sunbeds for a few guests and unless you're up before 8am, they were always all reserved by towels. Hotel has a no reserve policy but doesn't enforce it and you're not allowed to walk on the grass so unless you can get a sunbed you can't sit in the grounds while kids in the pool. Shame because it's one of e best pools I've seen and lots of life guards. Campo Aventura for children was one of the reasons we booked this one and it was closed for he whole time we were there. Kids activities in the evening but unless you eat at the hotel restaurant every night you'd never use them as they are all at dinner time 730-1015. We have a 3 yr old.....this should be when she's sleeping. Free Shuttle service runs from the other 2 port aventura hotels to Salou / Beach, but this one (which is more expensive) has none.

The laminate floor is dingy and carpet was ok but had some dog hair on it. Being a residence hotel there is no maid service and if you want fresh towels you have to take wet dirty towels to reception and they count them and give you fresh ones. There are free washers and dryers for guests. Hotel is close to I-77. There were people loitering near elevators several times and there was a party I guess on Saturday night.

The Candlewood Suites was clean and the staff was friendly. They only clean the rooms every 7 days, which was fine for us. However, if you needed anything, you could contact the Front Desk staff and they would accommodate you. There was no breakfast served because all of the rooms are equipped with a full kitchen and stocked with plates, silverware, etc. There is a mini-market in the lobby where you could purchase items by charging to your room or pay by cash. The room was clean, but smaller than I thought. There isn't a living room area, but one recliner in the corner, so I wouldn't necessarily consider that a suite but it was fine for the amount of time that we spent in the room. Also, our room was on the 1st floor facing the parking lot, so we could not open our curtains to let any light in or else everyone from the parking lot could see into our room. Something to consider when booking a room here. Overall, I would recommend this hotel.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/366","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/625"},{"id":8819,"date":"2016-09-16T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"Great desk staff.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/749","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/395"},{"id":8820,"date":"2016-02-22T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"This is a good place to stay for cheap.

A staple for road-tripping families, truck drivers and tour groups, the motel offers complimentary morning coffee and continental breakfasts. Another perk for travelers: Super 8 travel cups may be refilled for free at any of the motel's locations.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/426","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/898"},{"id":8876,"date":"2013-07-16T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"I have stayed here before and will stay here again.

When we walked in the lobby, it didn't look too bad, and we could tell it had been recently updated a bit. When we got in the room, and were setting down our things, I noticed a hair on the bed. I don't really tolerate hair in a clean hotel room, but I threw it away and let it go. When I was helping my daughter wash her hands soon after, the soap dispenser on the wall fell, and then I could tell the bathroom counter and sink were not cleaned, and there was more hair in the sink. The kids were excited to swim, so we ignored this mess and went to the pool. The pool was fine, but the hot tub was very murky. After swimming, we went back to the room and when I pulled the covers down in the bed, there were 2 more hairs. It was late, and we were tired, so I cleaned them up. In the morning, when I opened the shower curtain to take a shower, there was hair hanging from the shower faucet, and then from the towels! I couldn't handle anymore grossness, and we packed up and left. No one in my family got ready that morning, and there was no one one at the front desk to talk to. We skipped breakfast, because we were leary of how anything was really cleaned. I am extremely disappointed in this stay, as hair everywhere is not OK, not excusable.

Fridge and Microwave in the room is a big plus. The free hot breakfast was as good as any at this level of hotel. The location is a quick drive or short ride/walk into the center of town. Only a couple of neutral/negative comments. First, they do not have any roll-away beds available while other hotels in the area do offer them, and this made for awkward sleeping arrangements for the 3 in our group. Secondly, we came for a bicycle ride and since we didn't want to leave the bikes on the outside of the car overnight we planned on bringing them into the room, but the desk attendant stopped us and said the policy was no bikes in the rooms. On the plus side they were using the conference room as staging area for renovation material and he let us lock our bikes in that room overnight which was actually better, but if not under construction I am afraid this wouldn't be the case. In an area where there is a large amount of bicycle tourism not being able to bring the bike inside is a definite negative, though I do understand that with nice new rooms they don't want the dirt and grime of bikes being tracked inside. All in all, I was glad we spent a few extra for this hotel vs others we have stayed in due to the nice new renovations, friendly staff, and much more variety in the free breakfast.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/276","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/729"},{"id":9054,"date":"2016-04-07T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"The breakfast employee was very friendly.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/689","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/270"},{"id":9055,"date":"2015-08-15T00:00:00Z","rating":3,"comment":"The staff did not acknowledge me or my family.

I booked a room several days in advance for a wedding I was attending and I was told there would not be a cancellation fee - no need to do anything. I had a severe allergic reaction and was not able to attend. I didn't think anything of it until I received by credit card bill with a charge of 132.00!! When I called, the front desk lady/manager Diane was extremely rude and told me there was no way her employee would have told me that there was no cancellation fee. When I told her maybe the employee made a mistake, she said there was no way he would make that mistake and called me a liar. When I stated that sometimes employees make mistakes and I was positive I had asked about cancel fees, she said that was impossible and that I was wrong and every single hotel in the entire world(!!) charges cancellation fees. After a heated argument, I asked for the corporate number to make a complaint. I explained to the corporate office that I had been sick and was unable to attend and had been given no indication that there would be a cancellation charge (full cost for the over priced room). She was very nice and sympathetic and I confirmed that I could get a doctors note proving I was ill. She said that the Hotel owner or GM would call me to discuss and I would possibly have to provide the doctors note. That was over a week ago and I haven't heard from anyone.

I called the front desk and was told - well what would you like me to do. Changing rooms was apparently not an option. I finally attempted to use the shower and the drain didn't work and water flooded all over the bathroom. I then used the incredibly tattered towels to attempt to mop up the bathroom. Someone should have informed me that I was being giving and ADA room...and then imagine if you were in a wheelchair and had to use a flooding bathroom! Disgusting and disappointing.

The staff was excellent at the Holiday Inn Express at Port Clinton Ohio. Anytime something was requested (additional tables, chairs, etc.) for our meetings, the staff was always quick to respond to our needs. I wish more Hotels had the staff like that of this Holiday Inn Express. I did understand that they were in the processes of renovations at the time of my stay. Being that this was the case and the service and accommodations were excellent at the time I stayed there, I would like to stay at this Holiday Inn Express again once the renovations are complete. With doing the renovations it shows that this Holiday Inn Express has my comfort in mind. I liked the fact that you were always greeted with a smile and a friendly attitude by all of the staff members. The breakfast was fantastic, and might I add that I love the new pancake machine (first one I have ever seen). I love the idea that this Hotel had my comfort in mind with the new renovations and the choice in the staff members.

We figured that it was a big chain and would be nicer than some of the smaller independently owned hotels. We got to our hotel to check in about 1:00am after a long day at Cedar Point and were exhausted. We couldn't wait to check in and go to bed. When I tired to check in I was informed that they had people who decided to stay longer than they reserved the rooms for so they cancelled my reservation, that had been booked for over 2 weeks and already paid for, with no notification. They sent us to find a small hotel, not even close to the same standard, 15 minutes down the road, Needless to say I will not be staying with Holiday Inn in the future. I was thinking about blocking rooms with them for my upcoming wedding but this experience ruled that out.

The room was quite dark and furnished with very old fashioned furniture- not at all like the website, but maybe we were given that room because we only stayed one night and arrived late. However, I do have to say that the staff were friendly and accommodating.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/639","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/616"},{"id":9386,"date":"2015-05-10T00:00:00Z","rating":5,"comment":"Excellent hotel, service, position, good and people.

I booked at a special rate during the off season this time, and feel I got an amazing bargain! This is full-service hotel. There is a dining room onsite, serving dinner as well as breakfast. The front desk staff are friendly, gracious and helpful. The lobby has a couple of attractive and comfortable seating areas, in addition to a small bar. I had a lovely double room with its own patio, a spacious and beautifully appointed bathroom, and ample closet space. There was also a mini-bar and in-room safe. The hotel provides free wireless internet and it is quite fast. Breakfast was included, and was quite elaborate: fruit, cheeses, charcuterie, breads, eggs, bacon, juices. Coffee drinks are provided on request. There is a rooftop terrace with tables, chairs, and umbrellas for warm, sunny days... alas, I was there in winter! I look forward to my next stay. *The one thing that made me knock off a point is the absence of a ramp to allow easy transport of suitcases up the 3 flights of stairs from the parking lot up to the lobby.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/976","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/391"},{"id":9392,"date":"2015-10-17T00:00:00Z","rating":3,"comment":"The staff and fellow guests were friendly and views over Florence are very good. Our room was in a separate block. When the key was handed over no one mentioned that there were 2 stone steps down into the room and this made entry quite dangerous as the door opened inward and therefore just switching on the light to see meant you had to lean over the drop. The room was very small and was barely big enough for 2 people let along us and the two dogs. There were no tea or coffee making kit in the rooms so room service has to be used. The hotel restaurant is too small to accommodate the number of guests at breakfast meaning that groups of 3 or more people often have to wait to be seated after couples. During the summer they use the sun terrace to accommodate more people but this was October, if the terrace were covered by a glass conservatory it would make it an all year round space. We took dinner in the restaurant on the fist night and service was haphazard to say the least but the food was ok. Fiesole town 10 minutes walk up the hill is lovely and there are some good restaurants shops and cafs plus the amphitheatre and museum are worth a visit.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/977","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/523"},{"id":9393,"date":"2015-01-21T00:00:00Z","rating":3,"comment":"id put this hotel as somewhere between a 34 star.

To start with the location is a perfect one for visiting Florence - there is a single bus (7) that takes you right to within 5 minutes of the major attractions downtown. The bus stop is right next to the hotel, and the front desk will sell you bus tickets. And the view of Florence from the Fiesole hills is amazing. Fiesole itself is a great little town and well work a day of exploring as well. If you are in Fiesole, be sure to walk up the hill off of the main square for the even more stunning view of Florence.

The breakfast is really nice, plenty of choice and loads of it. The rooms were cleaned to a very high standard and the beds were lovely and large. The position is great, you can catch a number 7 bus up and down the hill either to Florence or Fiesole and it runs very frequently and late at night too (1 euro 20 I think if you buy single tickets from the hotel or you can buy a 3 day (12 euro)/5 day (not sure of price) ticket at the square where the bus ends up in Florence). I wouldn't say don't visit the hotel but some of the weaker points are as follows: 1 - the pool is very small, the photography on the website cleverly makes it look a lot bigger than it is, if you go, like me, thinking you'll swim a few laps every morning for exercise you'll be disappointed. 2 - the hotel is noisy, especially in the older section (can't say about the new section). Doors bang and the floor is stone so you hear every little noise, plus it's quite close to the road. Take earplugs! 3 - the staff are perfunctory - every request is fulfilled (although we did ask for an iron one night that never did turn up!) but it's done so with a fairly blank face - with the exception of 1 of the restaurant waitresses who was much friendlier and one of the receptionists who was also much friendlier. Take mosquito repellent, I got eaten alive! Oh one other tip is to ask to change rooms if yours is quite small, they're not all the same!","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/974","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/520"},{"id":9416,"date":"2015-10-30T00:00:00Z","rating":4,"comment":"C fait 15 ans que nous descendons rgulirement dans cet htel que nous aimons beaucoup.

Because of some staff turnover, we had some issues and miscommunications during the planning process. But, John took care of us and in the end we were very happy with our choice of venue. Our guests loved the location of the hotel and all that the neighborhood had to offer. The Glassdoor restaurant was very accommodating to my large family, and everyone was happy with their rooms.We didn't use a wedding coordinator, and the hotel was very accommodation about giving us ample time to set up, and Les was a big help in the set up process. The space is very customizable to colors/styles and can accommodate a large crowd easily.The food came out amazing, and our guests raved about it all. The chef took care of us, and even did a second tasting with us to ensure we got exactly what we wanted.The weather was amazing, and being able to have an outdoor wedding in January was a treat. Overall, we loved our wedding and are happy with our choice.

My Fiance and I hosted our engagement party at this venue. We we're very excited and reserved half of the venue for 3 hours of drinks and appetizers for family and friends. We are very disappointed with the service that we got from the event coordinator. During the booking process and contract stage she messed up sending me the wrong party information (BEO) and date several times. The night started and there was a miscommunication with the coordinator and the bar staff. For half the event our guests we told they could not order certain drinks from the bar that we had paid for! This was very embarrassing to us knowing that our 60+ guests we're told they could only order bud and bud lt when we had specifically talked about offering all draft beer + bud and bud lt. Secondly we were told we would have our own bartender to take care of our group seeing as there were 60 people at the event. We only saw 2 bartenders behind the bar 3 times that night. Most of the time there was only 1 bartender for the whole bar and had several people mention how long it took to get a drink. Long story short it is a pretty venue but you do not want to host an event here. The service is absolutely horrible. Even after the event when I brought up the issues I figured they would help us out with a discount or gift card and all they offered us was a buy 1 get 1 free coupon to brunch!","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/347","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/800"},{"id":9445,"date":"","rating":0,"comment":"to share your opinion of this businesswith YP visitors across the United Statesand in your neighborhood","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/730","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/355"},{"id":9446,"date":"2012-08-20T00:00:00Z","rating":0,"comment":"stay in the ocean front rooms in the upper tower, the rooms are amazing!! and say hi to joe at the front desk, he is very nice!","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/743","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/439"},{"id":9447,"date":"2013-06-16T00:00:00Z","rating":0,"comment":"great location, beautiful beach, rooms are all different since they are individually owned so you can get a favorite and return to the same one!","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/912","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/253"},{"id":9448,"date":"2014-08-09T00:00:00Z","rating":0,"comment":"great beach, clean rooms","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/890","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/6"},{"id":9449,"date":"2011-05-19T00:00:00Z","rating":0,"comment":"looking for a retreat location? the oceanfront litchfield inn provides meeting space, catering, group accommodation rates, bus parking and an oceanfront setting with easy access to the grand strand.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/781","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/255"},{"id":9450,"date":"2015-08-30T00:00:00Z","rating":0,"comment":"been staying here for years.  enjoy 2nd floor \"dunes\" rooms especially in fall and spring.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/976","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/619"},{"id":9451,"date":"2013-06-16T00:00:00Z","rating":0,"comment":"Great location, Beautiful beach, rooms are all different since they are individually owned so you can get a favorite and return to the same one!","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/887","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/140"},{"id":9452,"date":"2015-08-30T00:00:00Z","rating":0,"comment":"Been staying here for years.

All in all we got a good laugh out of it and went to the car for change... Fantastic stay!

Setting is perfect, away from the noise of downtown area, but still close enough for you to walk a couple of mins to the shops. Updated furnishings, decoration adds to the ambience. It was my husband and I's 2 year anniversary which I noted on the reservation, and they went out of their way (without me asking for special requests) to add wine and truffles- very sweet! Spotless room, contemporary setting, super affordable. I would have rated it 5 stars, but the walls are paper thin. The next door showers and voices in the other room was a bit disappointing, but other than that, the heated pool, continental breakfast all the other postives outweighed it.

Not sure if it was an isolated happening or its every night that way. Then there was a generator that ran all night long in the next parking lot which kept us from being able to sleep well Saturday night.

Hyatt Place is a nice hotel that offered a pool and a lovely breakfast, which was great for the kids. And plenty of eating options with thier room service or the tons of area options (we went to the National Coney right in the next parking lot) The elevator carpet was really dirty (well used, I am sure) The pillows are heaven, the beds are okay and the pull out bed was awful. The free WiFi is a lite version and is very hard to connect to during prime usage hours. Everything was very clean though and the room was nicely done and accommodated our family of 6 perfectly. The sofa is a huge L shape in its own living room area and the boys just slept on top rather that the pull out, the staff was great and gave us plenty of extra bedding and were very friendly and efficient.

En fait de bain remous c'tait une baignoire classique pas terrible du tout. Lorsque nous sommes arrivs nous avons eu une chambre avec 2 lits jumeaux, la chambre tait trs mal agence. Nous avons demand ds le lendemain changer de chambre et on nous a donn une chambre qui tait un peu mieux. Par contre les murs ne sont pas pais nous entendions tout ce que les voisins faisaient. Pas de double vitrage non plus et nous entendions les conversations dehors et les voitures passer. Le jaccuzzi sur le toit tait vide hors service. Les repas trs moyen et la salle de restaurant trs bruyante. En demi pension la bouteille de 50 cl d'eau cote 2,10 euros c'est un peu abuser pour une petite bouteille d'eau et on ne peut pas prendre de l'eau en carafe, si on ne prend pas de boisson ils nous retirent les verres. Cet htel ne vaut pas du tout les 4 toiles qu'il affiche. Par contre lorsqu'on sort de l'htel on se retrouve sur la promenade de la plage et c'est trs agrable.","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/455","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/435"},{"id":9966,"date":"2016-05-11T00:00:00Z","rating":3,"comment":"ON M A VENDU DES TICKETS POUR BOISSONS QUE JE N AI PAS PU UTILISER AU RESTAURANT C EST INADMISSIBLE","user":"http://localhost:3000/users/385","hotel":"http://localhost:3000/hotels/284"},{"id":9967,"date":"2015-09-05T00:00:00Z","rating":3,"comment":"Hotellet har, som alle hoteller, negative og positive sider.

Ikke regn med f rom med havutsikt selv om du nsker dette ved bestilling. Ved betale 10 Euro ekstra pr natt kan det vre en mulighet.

Notre avis est trs positif, habituellement on part en hotel club o on se retrouve loin de tout ! L c'tait diffrent, l'hotel est situ sur une longue pietonne (par la sortie de derrire) o on peut trouver une multitude de boutiques et de restos colls la plage Carihuela. Nous avons pris une formule en demi-pension et on ne regrette pas ce choix. Le petit djeuner est classique : buffet volont sans attente. Il n'y a pas de vrai jus d'orange seulement une sorte de sirop chimique. Au diner, on a toujours trouv quelque chose de bon manger, aucune queue pour aucun produit. Le personnel est trs agrable et au petits soins avec les clients. En revanche, l'eau est payante : 2,10 euros la bouteille de 50 cl (plate ou gazeuse). Autre mauvais point, en sortant du resto les vetement sentent fort la nourriture. La piscine est toute petite mais souvent vide, j'y suis all 2 ou 3 fois : mon fils tait presque seul dedans et moi j'tais sur un transat avec de la lecture. Les soirs dans le bar, il y a une animation : groupe de danse flamencon, chanteur ou mini club. A minuit souvent tout s'arrte pour laisser les gens dormir tranquillement. En sortant de l'hotel par derrire, droite 30 mtres sur la pietonne, il y a une agence de voyage qui propose des excursions moins chres que l'hotel. Nous sommes parti Grenade avec eux avec visite de l'alhambra.

It is a pity the pool is in the shade most of the day, maybe because of the time of year but the solarium on the 6th floor more than makes up for it. The food in the restaurant was always good and freshly prepared, I did not taste many desserts as the fruit was so good but people kept coming for more and dishes were replenished before being totally empty. Andalusian night was the best themed night, the food was great and the show too. The hotel is very close to the beach and we enjoyed long walks along the seafront, after dinner, in the balmy night. There are lovely restaurants in the area, from cheap and cheerful to gastronomic and plenty of choices.

Ook de verzorging in het restaurant mag meer aandacht. Als de tafellakens verwisseld worden liggen er vieze en vettige rode lakens onder, het serviesgoed is niet schoon of nog nat en veel messen hebben een verbogen punt, waardoor je bij het brood smeren de boterham kapot trekt. Een uur voordat het ontbijt afgelopen is worden bijv. de tomaten niet meer bijgevuld, de aangebroken fles wijn van de vorige dag is niet meer terug te vinden MAAR er wordt na 10 minuten zoeken wel een nieuwe fles geopend. Service aan de balie geweldig, de bar biedt veel vertier in de vorm van flamenco-avond enz. en het kijken naar de nederlanders met hun kaart/rummyspel zonder een drankje te gebruiken is opzienbarend. Je zou je schamen nederlander te zijn. Kamers zijn ruim en schoon, maar je ziet dat de dames van de schoonmaak wat meer tijd zouden mogen hebben zodat ze ook met een stofdoek kunnen zwaaien.
